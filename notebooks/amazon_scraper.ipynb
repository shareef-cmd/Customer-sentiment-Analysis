    "In today's digital era, customer reviews play a crucial role in shaping purchase decisions, especially in the highly competitive smartphone market. This project focuses on scraping customer reviews from Amazon for three flagship smartphones: Apple iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S24, and Google Pixel 7 5G.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to collect real user feedback directly from product pages on Amazon using web scraping techniques. These reviews provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction, common issues, and feature preferences. The collected data serves as the foundation for sentiment analysis and comparative studies between the devices, helping to understand public perception and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying and extracting review content (titles, bodies, ratings, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing the data in structured format (CSV)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing for natural language analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to Amazon's security and access limitations, scraping was performed cautiously and ethically, respecting rate limits and avoiding authentication-required content."
