"5.0 out of 5 starsIf you want Android phone, don't think twice for pixel",5.0,"After using it for a year.The Pixel 7 is a fantastic phone with a great camera. While the battery life can be a concern during video calls, switching to battery saver mode helps manage this issue effectively. As a stock Android device, it offers one of the best, most fluid experiences you can ask for, being fast and handy in daily use. All the little updates and fixes are quite well.In terms of photography, I feel the phone could benefit from a manual or pro mode for more control. The automatic processing sometimes makes images more contrasting than desired, and it would be nice if users had the option to choose between the processed image or the original shot. Additionally, the sound option can be a bit irritating at times.Overall, despite these minor drawbacks, the Pixel 7 is an excellent device and a good deal in almost every aspect.",Reviewed in India on 28 September 2024
1.0 out of 5 starsThe worst mobike you could buy in this segment,1.0,This is japanese model not induan version. The service centre couriers the devise to abroad if any service to be done out of warranty.The mobile heats up for normal usage also and doesn't allow you to take video more than 20min as this heats up with a pop up.Camera sounds can't be switched off the heat was about 44 degrees peak which i was unable to hold the phone in hand better go for iphone for few buck extra.Photo camera is great but video sucks at low light conditions the best thing you can do is go for alternative mobilesBy the way i broke my screen in just 12 days of buying this mobile.,Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023
4.0 out of 5 starsGreat feature packed phone at ₹45k,4.0,"Got the phone at 45k with credit card discount. Out of the box, just connecting to WiFi, the phone was overheating with Dec 2022 patch from the factory.Used pixel repair with adb and USB debugging enabled by following the on-screen instructions from the site to install April 2023 update. I used adb pm to run background optimization after applying April 2023 and June 2023 feature drop. Also disabled dual sim dual standby along with 2G which improved battery life and reduced standby drain overnight (4%).I have disabled Dual Sim Dual Standby by dialing *#*#4636#*#* > Phone Info > Toggle Enable DSDS from On to OffPros:- CPU performance is almost yesteryear flagship and has enough power. Battery saver or extreme battery saver didn't hamper single core or multi core performance. Coming from 4a which lacked serious CPU/GPU power Tensor G2 is a capable SoC.- Display is great quality and color accurate- Worthy camera upgrade when coming from 4a and can record in 4k 30 HDR or 60 FPS on non HDR .- On device AI/ML is much faster than 4a and voice assistant doesn't use too much battery.-Speakers are very balanced and tuned for high volume output at max volume though you lose some mid low or bass focused music will not seem good.- Fp sensor and face is decent. It was fast enough- Build quality is top notch- LTE and WiFi is much better when upgrading from 4a. I thought LTE signal would be worse but it is only slightly better say -2 to -3dBm.- App optimization is top notch and 90Hz felt like 120Hz. Had to slow down animations to 5x on both 4a and 7 to notice huge difference when comparing 60Hz and 90Hz refresh rates. 4a and 7 UI is so slick and you'll notice only when scrolling a big text webpage and 90Hz is noticeable.- Clear Calling is great and helps in noisy or crowded place. On par or beats Apple's Voice Isolation feature.- Auto Spatial Audio on BT or headset. Almost on par Windows Sonic.Cons:- Better out of the box experience without resorting to adb and manually tune it.- 5G connectivity can be improved and currently its very aggressive as low signal drops it to LTE/4G.- Runs hotter on sustained workloads and throttle point is 42C after which SoC throttle down to maintain temperature. Needs vapor chamber with next version as graphite sheet can only dissipate heat away and not cool it under heavy loads.- No Google VPN- Launch Price was on higher side- No free uploads to Photos app which was available on 4a.- No power adapter in the box and somewhat slower charge speed, if you have Google 18W PD adapter use the same as 20/22V PPS with 30W adapter barely makes difference.",Reviewed in India on 22 June 2023
5.0 out of 5 starsPixel in a budget. (A review after the launch of P7A),5.0,"If you have pushed your budget till 50k you might think why not buy an iPhone by applying some extra offers and ways to buy it instead of getting a pixel. You might be right if you are an Apple follower or just want to get into the ecosystem.For all the other consumers out there who prefer Android, well this is just the right phone to get.Design- Very distinctive, I mean anyone from a far will either recognise that this phone is a pixel or will come and ask you about a phone. (Side note it can be a conversation starter)Performance- If you do not game on your phone then this is a wise choice because let's face it, there are performance centeric devices out there that do not have such a budget and can full fill your gaming needs. (Personally I do do not game on my phone anymore as the PUBG MOBILE era has gone and I have moved to PC gaming myself). If gaming is not your concern then this phone performs very quick and snappily, be it going through multiple apps at once, opening closing of apps etc it is just fluid. If you are not a heavy gamer, you can casually game on your phone too it is capable enough.Screen- The screen is fluid and responsive to even the slightest touches. It is sharp enough to make the movie/series look very good with displaying all the colours accurately. And since it is an amoled, yes it has deep blacks and trust me the wallpaper looks stunning. Coming from a 60hz phone yes I have noticed the difference from 60 to 90 and it feels pretty good using the phone at 90hz.Camera- This is where a pixel never disappoints, it is said that a picture is worth more than a 1000 words and when you take a photo from this (with a creative mind, ofcourse not just point and shoot randomness) you can really tell a story. Apart from the pictures the pixel 7 has improved videography as well which many people complaint in the older pixel. Stable video can be shot over this phone and if you want to shoot some quality videos then this can do it no problem. (Also there is a YouTube channel which shows the capabilities of a pixel 6a which shoots at night as well as day, those videos look stunning. Just imagine what this bad boy can do then.)Battery- This is very debatable aspect of a phone, Pixel 7 has a battery that can last a day and half if you are not using it most of the time, let's say you are at your office working on your laptop, or while travelling focusing on the road, or eventually back at home and spending time with your family. In that case it will last. Where as on the other hand if you are continuously using your phone texting your friends, clicking photos videos uploading on socials making memories, going to places using navigation/GPS and a network then it may last you 3/4 of the day. And you are constantly gaming on it you may have to charge during the day maybe even twice.It all boils down on your usage. In my usage it lasted me a day with all the activities mentioned above, some mixed and some excluded. On an average I am getting an average of 5 hours before I kill the phone at night. I charge the phone overnight so there was no requirement of fast charge in the first place. Wireless charging comes in hand only if you have a fast chi charger.Few points to note:Pixel series is the smartest smartphone that you can buy.This phone has some editing magic when it comes to photos (eraser, unblur, motion capture etc)The haptics are really great and they do notify you well enough even if the phone is in pockets during a bike ride.Yesterday Google launched their pixel 7 a and I am not saying that it is un necessary but seeing what that delivers in that price makes me question the existence of pixel 7 because it is basically a pixel 7 with plastic back. A few differences apart (screen, build, cameras) if you are getting a chance to grab the pixel 7 not the 7a around 45k then definitely go this.Fingerprint reader did had some issues at the start but when you delete your finger scans a couple of times(let's say like 3-4) and then redo the scan it works well. Also I would recommend to scan and keep two prints of the same thumb to reduce any more errors.They have added face scan as well that works like a charm.Last thing I wanted to bring to your notice was that I received the Japanese version of the pixel, still did not arrive to reason till this day as to why was that? Even when pixels are started to ship out to India.On an ending note tho, I came from a pixel experience flashed k20 pro running on Android 13 so there was nothing really fancy that I liked about the stock Android because at this point i was using stock from 3 generations and stock is CLEAN.",Reviewed in India on 12 May 2023
5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing product,5.0,"The phone itself is a masterpiece the AI makes the photos more realistic that what it shows. The stock android is already a thing that i am attracted to. So, it checks all my boxes for buying it.The fingerprint scanner is not great as that of Oneplus but not as bad either the on screen scanner is around just below the center of screen so, its a weird position but overall its ok. Once you have scanned a finger correctly (tho it took me a few tries) it didnt have any problem recognising it.UI is of stock android is already good and free of bloatware so its a blessing in disguise. The AI really learns from your day to day working around the phone and optimize the battery around it. A lot of features as Transcribe and Live captions help a lot when you are not able to play sound in reels but you want to know whats going on. It live transcribes what they are speaking. A lot of wonderful features.But oh boy the Camera is above all, tensor G2 chip really knows it way around photographs. What is shown on screen while capturing will differ by heavens after its processed. The processed image Crisp and crystal clear.10/10 would recommend as its value for money",Reviewed in India on 11 January 2023
5.0 out of 5 starsAwesome phone but dont buy it from Amazon,5.0,"Nice product, after using of one month I am writing that I am very happy with pixels 7, still did not get any issue from the device. Overall good ecperince fro pixels 7 but guys do not buy it from Amazon as the are not autorized dealer of the Pixels.You will not get any warrant from google for the same, my products did nor get started after getting in the pool and after visitng the service centre tey deneyed to provide warrant claims as it was ordered fro Amazon",Reviewed in India on 6 May 2023

4.0 out of 5 starsAwesome phone,4.0,"I have been using this phone for the last 6 months.Pros:-1 If you are a photo lover, this phone is definitely for you.The picture quality is too good with sharp resolution and clarity.2 The body is very durable and doesn't slip at all from your hands while handling.3 The sound quality is also very good and the features like""Say decline or Say answer "" are very unique, if you are busy and not able to use your hands.4 The tensor 2 chip is the winner in the game of mobile market as the performance is top notch.Cons:-1 Far and most irritating is the touch sensor which is 99% not working while using the phone.I don't understand what went wrong while doing R n D with the touch sensor.2 The battery life is poor if you are into gaming.It won't last long if you use your phone for watching videos or playing games.Overall,If you are looking for a very good camera phone, go for it without hesitation.Since, it's a Google phone, it comes with advanced security patches and frequent updates so no need to worry about that.You won't have to buy a new phone in near future if you are going to buy this phone as it's sturdy and advanced.I have shared some photos clicked on this phone so that you can get a clear idea about the camera.",Reviewed in India on 17 June 2023

"4.0 out of 5 starsGreat camera and OS, but heating issue",4.0,I'm finding some issues with the operating system like the device sudden switches off on its own and gets heated while using the camera or on normal outfoor use in mumbai. I'm not sure if I should replace this device for this reason.Camera features are good. I'm satisfied with the photos and camera. My previous phone was Samsung m31 and I didn't find some Quantum leap in my user experience. Camera sometimes stops while recording 4k at 60 fps due to heating. Can be used for making videos indoors but heating becomes an issue while shooting outdoors. Camera stabilisation is exceptional. All in all I think it's worth the price and I don't regret not buying an iphone at all.,Reviewed in India on 19 February 2023
4.0 out of 5 starsGoogle Pixel 7 5G,4.0,"I bought Pixel 7 5G on Jan 2023 and following are some points I personally want google to look after or anyone can consider while buying it. My comparison is based on Samsung S22 FE or S21 FE series..1- Worst fingerprint reader ever (fails 9 out of 10 times, google has to look seriously about this feature)2- Out door photos are as good as S22 or S21 but indoor photos or low light photos are darker than S series.3- Absence of physical 2 sim slots though it provides e-sim option, however new to e-sim person will struggle for initial setup for 2nd sim.You can find good qualities in any comment.",Reviewed in India on 29 January 2023
