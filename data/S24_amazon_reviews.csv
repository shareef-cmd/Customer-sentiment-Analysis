"5.0 out of 5 starsNot flagship material,..but now I think it is!",5.0,"This is an updated review :So just moved from S20, which I had for so many years to the new S24. The phone itself is good, everything works fine.. but that's expected. Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞",Reviewed in India on 17 May 2024
5.0 out of 5 starsAn amazing compact phone - The Exynos2400 is very good with no issues as with the previous chipsets.,5.0,"I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience.",Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024
4.0 out of 5 starsMy true feelings about this phone 😃,4.0,"Everything is on point as expected. But there are 1 or 2 things i want to share.1. Metal edges are little bit on sharp side so without cover it is difficult to use.2. If you live in warm area, it really gets hot and i found frame skips, but that was one time in 1 year of use.3. Battery backup : Screen on time is about 4-4:30 hrs, sometimes feels low sometimes okay. So take your powerbank with you everytime you go out.Other than these this phone is a beauty.That's my review after 1 year of usage. 🫡",Reviewed in India on 9 June 2025

4.0 out of 5 starsSheerly beautiful with but with it's limitations,4.0,"Update (04th August) :Reducing one star this time.Now using it after 15 days, certainly there are some limitations in this phone. Albeit they can be addressed. First is phone started to heat up on very basic operations in first one week, later on it gradually got under control. It's still not 100% cool while doing basic stuff such as browsing, playing music. But not as much as it was in first week. Maybe battery is taking time to recalibrate.Second is battery performance. This is where it gets tricky and requires a patience and experiments. Over a all last two I have done changes in setting where with same usage pattern battery can literally vary from 5hrs screen on time to 7hrs sot. This can get frustrating to figure out.Phones default settings out of factory might provide somewhere around 5-5:30hra sot. If you need more then you need to tweak the settings a lot like - putting apps to deep sleep, turning google search app off, turning off adaptive battery protection, turning off Customization services or using it for very specific apps. (I use it for routines and modes only where while charging only it turns on adaptive battery protection.) these settings tweaks and experiments I managed to get 6:30-7hrs of screen on time. Phone with such a premium price shouldn't require user to perform such analysis to get best out of it.Third is camera : I am still not 100% convinced that this can take better pictures in all scenarios. In low light I have observed it's hit or miss. Images are soft in low light. Maybe software update need to fix this. Other than this under normal light condition camera works at reasonably respectable quality.--------‐-----------------------------------------------Coming from using ios for last 6 years, this is altogether different and enriching experience. The size in palm of your hand feels so beautiful that in incomparable to anything else in terms of ease of using the phone. There had been hell of debate over snapdragon vs exonys, and quite valid biases towards exynos considering it's poor legacy. But this time it looks like Samsung have almost nailed it. Haven't though tested with heavyweight games but day to day experience has been hyper smooth and quite a respectable battery of almost 7 hours of screen time. Battery charging takes a time at 25w max but it was never an issue for users like me. I am not in rush. Sound quality is great, camera looks decent though its too early to compare with iPhone picture quality, it produces reasonably well lit well exposed images. Overall fully worth the price.Would be updating this review again after few months of usage.",Reviewed in India on 23 July 2024

"4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Display & Performance, But Battery Life Needs Work",4.0,"The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid smartphone with a lot to offer, but there are a few areas where it falls short. Here's a breakdown of its key features:Battery: The battery life on the S24 is decent, but not great. You can expect to get through ~5 hours on a single charge with moderate use, but standby time is poor. This means the battery drains even when you're not using the phone.Camera: The camera system on the S24 is good, but not exceptional. It takes good photos in most lighting conditions, but it doesn't quite match up to the best camera phones on the market.Display: The display on the S24 is excellent. It's bright, clear, and has a high refresh rate for smooth scrolling.Heat Management: The S24 tends to heat up more than expected, even during basic tasks like browsing the web. This becomes a bigger issue when using the camera, where it can get quite hot even after short recording sessions or charging your phone.OS: The S24 comes with Android 14 with lot of improvement, but expecting to receive an update to Android 15 at the earliest (Even Nothing 2a has received it)Other Considerations:Design: The S24 has a sleek and stylish design that's comfortable to hold.Performance: The S24 is a powerful phone that can handle even the most demanding tasks (not gaming)Software: Samsung's One UI software offers a variety of features and customization options.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a good phone with a lot to offer, but the battery life and heat management issues hold it back from being great. If you're looking for a phone with a great camera and excellent display, the S24 is a good option. However, if battery life and heat management are important to you, you may want to consider another phone.",Reviewed in India on 30 May 2024

2.0 out of 5 starsPhone is in good condition but is not a great buy,2.0,"Have been using Oneplus 6t for about 5 years after which I switched to Samsung s24. I was expecting a lot more advancements but the phone was a disappointment. Mainly due to it's battery life, reboot time, night camera, face unlock and fingerprint scanner which in my opinion is below average from its price point.The processing speed is average, sound quality is average. I'm a minimal user and yet I feel the battery life is terrible. Especially when it's on low battery the phone drains out in minutes. Cannot capture a good selfie in the night even when the phone is on a stand.I do like the new AI features but I would rather prefer to have the basic functionality to be better. As for the AI features,  you can choose to delete an object from the photo you took but can't choose to insert an object you want. Instead, you can choose the object you want to alter, and run the AI tool hoping that it understands what you want.A cool feature I was interested in was the inbuilt language translator, however, I realised later that only a limited number of international languages are available for use. All in all, it would be better to get a chatgpt subscription rather than buy this phone for it's AI features.The charger was another disappointment.  The phone does not come with a charger but only a charging cable. This phone would take upto 5 hours to charge on a regular dash charger so I had to buy a specific 45w charger from samsung. The charging cable looked very feeble, and not so surprisingly, broke within 2 months of usage.I usually have loved all my phone purchases and this was the first phone I regret buying. I miss my oneplus 6t and I do consider giving up this phone in exchange for a new oneplus or an iphone. I wish Amazon India had a return option for phones like they provide in the USA.Edit: I tried to exchange this phone for the new oneplus or iphone but the s24 128gb 8gb is not accepted for exchange all across the amazon app. Now I'm stuck with this thing.",Reviewed in India on 8 November 2024
4.0 out of 5 starsS23 vs S24 Exynos,4.0,"If you're torn between the Samsung Galaxy S23 Qualcomm version and the S24 Exynos version, I've got some insights that might help you decide.I've had my hands on both, and here's the deal: the S24's screen is a total eye-catcher, outshining the S23's already impressive display. The build has a more premium vibe, though the S23 isn't far behind in quality.The game-changer for me was Samsung's 7-year promise for OS and security updates on the S24 – that's longevity right there! While the Exynos 2400 might boast higher benchmarks than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, in everyday use, it's pretty much neck and neck.Now, my wife's S23 stays cool as a cucumber, but my S24? Gets a tad warm during updates – nothing alarming, though. And battery life? Identical twins!So, who should snag the S24 Exynos? If you're all about future-proofing with those sweet updates, it's your match. Otherwise, the S23 still rocks and comes with a friendlier price tag. If you want to game, then you should not buy this, and I will suggest to buy a bigger phone for better cooling and bigger screen.And hey, if you're comparing it to the iPhone 15 base model – the S24 Exynos has got it beat. Wishing we had the Qualcomm version here in India, but hey, Samsung's catching up fast in the processor race.",Reviewed in India on 15 March 2024

5.0 out of 5 starsAmazing Device,5.0,"The design is sleek and modern, with a durable glass back and metal frame, giving it a premium feel. Samsung has retained the stunning Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, which supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and an immersive visual experience. The display is bright and vibrant, offering excellent color accuracy and HDR10+ support, which is perfect for media consumption.The camera system on the Galaxy S24 is one of its standout features. It boasts a versatile triple-lens setup with improved low-light performance, thanks to its upgraded main sensor and enhanced image processing. The zoom capabilities have also been refined, making the phone an excellent choice for mobile photography enthusiasts. The portrait mode, night shots, and video stabilization are impressive, competing with the best in the market.Battery life is solid, with a capacity around 4,900mAh that should comfortably last through a day of moderate to heavy use. Samsung's fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging are also present, though the absence of a charger in the box may be disappointing for some. The phone also runs the latest version of Android with Samsung's One UI, which adds useful features and a clean user interface.5G connectivity, water and dust resistance (IP68), and robust security features like the in-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition round out the Galaxy S24's feature set. However, the price point remains high, which might make it a better option for those willing to invest in a premium flagship phone.Overall, the Galaxy S24 delivers a fantastic all-around experience with top-of-the-line hardware, impressive cameras, and a beautiful display. It’s a great choice for anyone looking for a high-performance smartphone, though its steep price might give some pause.",Reviewed in India on 23 October 2024

Just want to focus on only one aspect i.e. this is a premium segment phone no doubt but the battery needs to tuned for serious. It drains like anything. It is understandable that because of the screen and the refresh rate battery life is less but these are premium parts of this phone and you cannot avoid to use a higher refresh rate screen. This is because as per the chipset used, it is highly essential to improve the efficiency.Other then that this is a fantastic phone where it can beat IPhone 15 series and Google Pixel 8 series in many aspects.The display is amazing, performance is also very smooth, and the camera is the master asset in this phone. Trust me you won't find a telephoto lens in any of the base variants of premium segment phone(neither iphone nor google pixel)except Samsung.

5.0 out of 5 starsMind blowing!!!,5.0,"I recently got my hands on the Samsung S24, and after spending some quality time with it, here's my detailed review:**Camera Performance:**In daylight, the camera performs exceptionally well, capturing vivid and detailed shots. The colors pop, and the images are sharp, making it a delight for photography enthusiasts. However, during low-light conditions, there's noticeable noise in the photos. Nevertheless, I'm optimistic that Samsung will address this issue with future updates.**Battery Life:**Contrary to some complaints about the battery, I found it to be quite impressive. With the amazing battery optimization feature tucked away in the settings, I easily managed to squeeze out 8-9 hours of screen time. It's important to note that heavy users might experience faster drain, but for moderate usage, the battery life is commendable.**Heat Management:**One drawback I noticed was the device heating up with prolonged usage. While it's not a dealbreaker, I do hope Samsung addresses this issue in subsequent updates to ensure a smoother user experience, especially during intensive tasks.**AI Features:**The AI features on the Samsung S24 are a standout. The AI editor allows for creative freedom, enabling users to produce stunning photos effortlessly. Whether it's enhancing colors or adding artistic effects, the AI capabilities truly shine, elevating the overall photography experience.**Overall Impression:**Despite a few minor quirks, the Samsung S24 is undoubtedly a must-buy phone. Its exceptional camera performance in daylight, coupled with impressive battery life (thanks to optimization features) and innovative AI capabilities, make it a solid choice for anyone in the market for a reliable smartphone. With potential updates on the horizon to address concerns like low-light photography and heat management, the Samsung S24 is poised to be a top contender in the smartphone market.",Reviewed in India on 19 April 2024

5.0 out of 5 stars👍Good Performance and Camera 🤩🤩,5.0,"I purchased this mobile from Amazon on release date. Initially the camera clarity with over saturation was observed and battery backup was noticed poor. After April 2024 update, samsung fixed those issues. I have uploaded the screenshot for battery which lasts up to 7 hours. Camera quality and shutter speed also improved. Any issues, the samsung will update positively within short time.Pros:☆ Samsung promised 7 OS updates upto Android 21.☆ Build quality is nice.☆ Camera quality has been improved. Front camera is awesome.☆ Battery backup is good☆ Sound quality is good with stereo speakers☆ No lag when handling any apps.☆ Samsung Exynos processor performs nice. No heating issues.☆ Data transfer by USB 3.2 is awesome.Cons:¤ This phone uses LPTO AMOLED display technology. The colour reproduction and quality is much poorer than Super AMOLED. Display quality will disappoint you.¤ I have enabled Touch Sensitivity in settings eventhough the finger unlock struggles after fixing screen guard.¤ Still the camera needs to be improved especially 50MP shows nice image in display. After capturing,  it adds contrast  towards black making it poor.Hope future update may resolve this issue.Overall this is high performance and nice built quality. Thank you Amazon for fast delivery.",Reviewed in India on 30 March 2024

4.0 out of 5 starsExynos is Good,4.0,Samsung is only option for a person who don't like Chinese phones. Pixel service center not reachable for us. Exynos 2400 is very fast and responsive for me as I don't play games. I get very good battery backup for a full day usage. I like the one Hand phones only and beside flagship you don't find any these days. Display is very good. Touch I'd works like charm. Sound output is also very good and loud. So overall it's a phone for handy likes and moderate users. Price should be less about 65-70k ( that's why 1 star less),Reviewed in India on 6 March 2024

3.0 out of 5 starsCompact and smooth device with poor battery life and frequent heating,3.0,"The device can easily be used with one hand. The display is quite bright. 120hz  adaptive refresh rate works really well. The phone can heat up during initial setup. The cameras are good for clicking sharp vivid pictures, it doesn't do a great job in capturing moving subjects. The battery life is not great, can only get about 4-5hrs screen on time at the end of the day. These issues are primarily because of the small form factor. If you are willing to look past these issues then it is one of the best options you can go for. Do consider pixel 9 of you want an android alternative.",Reviewed in India on 17 July 2024

1.0 out of 5 starsNever buy this Overheating 4g only Exynos lagging phone. It's no longer like S23 with Snapdragon,1.0,"Unable to do livestreams because of frequnet excessive overheating and 4g network switch from 5g because of itI bought this samsung galaxy s24 base 256gb only for building my youtube carrier and spent nearly ₹80,000/- but this phone have exynos unlike the old s24 which had snapdragon. After just few months price dropped so much that it's crazy. 50 to 60k for this now.I have never bought anything of such high price, i saved for this phone for 10+ years of saving money and my disappointment is immeasurable.My phone is overheating and lagging too much when playing genshin impact.When i play any game or do livestream my phone overheats and the 5g connection disconnects, and it switches to 4 g, which is not unlimited.This issue can't be fixed as samsung is ignorant enough to first cheap out on hardware and software and then call every issue i tell as a ""feature not a bug""They say to ""just reset every time"" which still does not fix.I want my hard earned money back as this is the biggest scam ever to me, i should have bought a computer instead. No snapdragon on s24 now. Cheap. Slow 25w charging takes more than 1 hour and heats your phone until it's fully cooked. I'm cooked aswell. It's also uncomfortable to hold and way too small to type on using both thumbs. Small screen makes you bring closer the phone bending your neck.",Reviewed in India on 10 October 2024
