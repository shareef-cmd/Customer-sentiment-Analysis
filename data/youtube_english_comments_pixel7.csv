Is this better than samsung a36
I got a Google pixel ad in that video
"Don‚Äôt buy thi phone‚Ä¶,my phone motherboard was burn because i just play CODM‚Ä¶ üôÖüôÖüôÖüôÖ"
Wondering what your favorite mid ranger of them all is
"hey bro
is it still worth in December 2024
how does it compare to the Samsung s23 fe 
I can't afford a newly released phone so i am going for a past phone still available in market"
"Guys, this phone is huge, it's not compact at all."
Really bad for eyes. I sent it back to google and fighting for refund now. Do not buy this shit you will have eye strains and headaches every day.
Amen my new phone ‚ù§
Ideal when you install calyxos on it
Is This ai or a voice over?
"Whos watching this in a pixel 7 , I shoulda got the pro for 100 bucks more , the replacement screens are cheaper for whatever reason but the way I thought about it was I'm not gonna use the third camera , and I didn't but damn, btw all the cases available for it suck and a lot of em give connectivity issues I feel robbed for 600$ and shortly after like a month later the 8 was released , still a good phone but damn , I'm just gonna repair it to get my money's worth cause trading it in is only 200$"
"Refresh rate, brightness, and charging speed are deal breakers"
20w and 2 hrs to charge easy pass
Thanks mateüòÖ
"I had this P7 for about 2 weeks refurbished set after my P5a panel screen gone..just updated android 14, feels awesome..SOT average 6.5hours..."
Shit the fingerprint scanner takes a full press to unlock. The horror a deal breaker the time wasted. What a nightmare. (Sarcasm)
"The battery and charging speed for this phone are a deal breaker for me. Otherwise, everything else is very good."
I can't believe the chin man. I can't wrap my head around it.
Only 3 years support is so laughable.
Lovely voice. A dream.
"hi, found this phone for less than 500$ and the store is reliable, thinking of buying this bc im struggling with a a30s of almost 4 years..."
Is the screen an off white color and not a white hue?
"In New York there were no English/Russian bilingual supporters of me. But someone used me and my accounts to switch languages of every app from English to Russian. This person did not provide me with any normality. Right now tge app that I installed by beeing not in New York recently changed the language on Russian. This is all people care about here, and more. But, to say that I am crazy and were stressed at work is better than to accept that it wasn't a stress. The phone was bought in New York, and some apps just disappeared, and after that a few new apps got installed, that not only concerning a privacy of the person, but just doubling other apps I have. After leaving New York I was asking two people from the field of work in IT if they want to try to compete American apps by creating their competitors. They said no, and I do not need this problem anymore. Hopefully, this hacker will stop. And, if it is a team, they will be stopping using me already."
"Thank you for reacting through the email from Samsung. Unfortunately, their team, the same as yours, did not return my photos, but it's nice to get a notification that shared photos will be deleted from shared account."
"By the way, the Samsung phone, the notebook and Google Pixel, that I had before, are all licensed."
"Awesome review, just what I want to know about a cell phone."
Which one would be better ?pixel 6 pro or pixel 7 considering battery life & camera?
worst phone i had. when i had to sett brightness to 100% then this crp was not meant for me. my other phone uses half the brightness and looks like pixel 7 on 100% brightness üòÜ. no wonder this phone is cheap..avoid if you can
"I see you're another one absolutely in love with this. Smaller phone. Yes. And when you watch a full screen movie you get a black camera dot to ponder throughout the film. Plus you're probably not seeing the whole original screen. Then there's no portal for your expensive ear phones. But you won't mind another purchase to solve that issue at a different store because we say so. Then there's the fact that normal usage of the phone causes it to heat up. That doesn't sound good but hey, it's the new normal. Then there's the screen protector you told the nice sales woman you didn't need but she sold it to you anyway for $65. Then the router you stupidly took home for the tablet you told her you never use that's now $20 a month. Oh yes. When you return the router which weighs 20lbs to the dealer you find out that it's up to you to return via UPS. The nice dealer people are now not so nice. Manager, ""anything you walk out of this store with the is non returnable"". You leave shaking and humiliated and have dark thoughts about Verizon. But hey, it's the new norm!"
Where did you get that black hoodie?
Very rare battery life‚Äôs are large anyway
Hate those raised cameras with a passion. Samsung already moved on from it so I expect them to drop it by the time the Pixel 8 comes around.
"There seems to a bigger problem which for some reason no one is pointing out.I myself own a Pixel 7 and I have also seen quite a bit of Pixel 7's in my friends hands and all of them have WASHED OUT DISPLAY ,to say it simply "" ITS NOT WHITE"" its warm, and pale it doesn't even look natural and thats such a big turn off coming from 3Yr old Oneplus 7 Pro. Front camera is okayish and the display makes it look worse than it actually isüòÆ‚Äçüí®. its like "" if you want to watch someone or something it looks washed out and if someone wants to watch you, then your mid level selfie camera will let you down "". The screen is horrible next to Pixel 3's and 4's which came out ages ago;  its not about the CLARITY its about the COLOURS..........Ugh #hateit ."
"Was gonna get but the amount of people complaining of short battery life, in todays world lack of battery capacity is an issue. Might just stick to IPhone."
"Don't like the review, guy speaks sooo fast.. sounds like a robot reading from a prepared script."
"Is that phone the same model for AT&T? , cause I got the Samsung S10 and I don't like it, but I'm in to buy the google 7 AT&T,"
Don't buy the note 20 it has a lot of display issues. Go for pixel
Brightness is no problem for me as pixel 7 user. I even enabled extra dim to restrict the max brightness for battery value and my eyesight
"I'll be honest I don't mind. warmer theme just makes your eyes hurt less. true it is not white at all, but you can just get used to it"
Got thhis phone today
Ordered mine online. Just awaiting for its arrival. Lol.
Something doesn't add up... The speakers on mine are terrible! No base at all. The very loud but you don't want to turn them up because they become screechy.
Camera is worse than the Galaxy S10 Plus............
"I am having problem with external mic on instagram, it just doesnt recognize. I am use external mic on Tiktok, native camera app, whatsapp etc, however it seems that Instagram doesn¬¥t recognize external mic. Is anybody having the same issue?"
"Is it Good forme to switch from Galaxy S10 do this Pixel 7 ??? Especially in terms of audi,screen, camera and over all smoothness"
"I'm using a pixel 7 now, the only thing I wish was different is the finger print sensor, should of kept it in the back middle of the phone."
Nice photos from Sofia! :) Thank you for the great review!
Mine delivered today. Currently I have iPhone 12 mini and Samsung A53 5G. This phone feels very heavy. I'll take it on a test drive tomorrow and see.
I don't trust the heavily censored Google as a search engine let alone a phone! You'd have to be mad to trust & buy one. Huge NO from me.
"I hate my pixel 7.  My favorite ear buds don't pair.  Some ear buds pair fine but not my favorite set and now my skull candy buds wont pair either.  Also the Pixel 7 wont cast to my Roku or Fire stick.  Apparently there's a 3rd party app one can use but come on, who wants to give yet another company access to your phone through an anther app?"
"Bought the pixel 7 after owning the pixel 2 for the last four years. I'm currently looking for reviews because I'm literally on the verge of returning it. Frankly disappointed with the camera, the screen seems to enlarge everything and gives YouTube/insta/tiltoks a cheapppppppp look. The front facing camera does the same thing, no quality is added and I might say it's worse than the pixel 2 front facing camera. I'm so confused as to why I'm feeling this way about this phone. I was really expecting a lot when it came to waiting four years for the 7."
Google! Please make a new phone the size of the 4a.
"~50% of this video is about camera quality, as a guy... I am not interested..."
On The Pictures...Is he your wife ?
How this compare to the the iphone 13 pro?
Pixel 6 user üíØ bad ass phone!
I bought one from Verizon but it cost me 800 in 2023 why are they more expensive
can you tell me the experience? how is battery?
"How was it, I've bought one and would like to know how it is, thank you."
@KenanFaik-q5m¬† I didn't like the feel of it. Sold it few days later.
"Do any of the pixels after the 3's have any screen issues? I have a pixel and the screen blacks grey out and look choppy especially at night. The screen also sometimes just stick on a black screen, i'm not sure what's up with that."
"Thank you for the review. here is in my country s23 is in pre order, and pixel 7 is not official. I (almost) prefer pixel 7, but the benefit to  buy s23 in pre order is a very good deal (double storage), and benefit update android 4x, while pixel only 3x. Both in a same price now pixel 7 in 128GB and s23 in 256GB. (pre order). Is there features in s23 make the photos more natural like pixel 7? I prefer natural camera. and what is the disadvantage features to use pixel in not available country ? Is auto focus bug in front camera pixel 7 resolved now? What about video stabilization? which one is better? Im the type to use phone in long term. let me know your opinion please."
Is it better than iphone 14 night video?
"20w charging? Damn, that might be a deal breaker for me. I've been using a OnePlus 7t with 35w charging for a few years and I cannot see myself ever going to anything slower. It's an amazing feature. A 10 minute charge will get you by if you're in a bind."
"As soon as Google phones dropped the jack, I lost interest ü§ê"
Just got mine's today in Lemongrass color! So elegant and beautiful phone with nice specs! Upgrading from A50 after almost 4 years feels really nice! <3
"Considering that this has the same price for what the a54 is gonna come at.
Recon this is a better phone?"
I have a 7 pro myself but my girl is jealous she is thinking of upgrading to the pixel 7
two hours charge :D
When they get the pixel 6 working properly without any glitches I might look at the 7
I got an iPhone ad on this video LMAO the irony is amazing.
"I  was an avid Pixel fan, till I got this rubbish phone as a gift. It's so slippery you literally cant hold it, it gets hot while using, mobile data doesn't work for an hour after you switch it off and the on. I miss my pixel 3a."
It's only available in the us ?
Google 7 is the best phone! :3
I got the Pixel 7 around three days ago. I can say that battery life is a little bit disappointment.
Bulgaria.... How much I miss my country
"Guys help me out , s22 ultra or the regular pixel 7? I don‚Äôt game , I just use YouTube , social media , no tik tok lol just Fb and ig, music and basically just turning hotspot on most the time , which one is better ? And less heating etc"
It works! Thank you for your help!
Android 10 is still my favorite version of Android. It was the smoothest version of Android in my experience.
I have the same phone and I love it!
Lol. Doing exactly the same as you. Getting my lemongrass Pixel 7 next week after 4 years with A50 üòÖ hope we're both happy with the upgradeüéâ
"¬†@hedyddphillips7240¬† You'll love it, the higher refresh rate display, fast and super smooth UI, an amazing camera setup with a day of battery life! Its brilliant!"
Omg I also want a lemongrass one
‚Äã¬†@camotech1314¬†Get one. I just bought a brand new one off of eBay for $250!!! I always wait until the new one comes out and then I buy the previous one brand new for a third of what it costs when they first come out.
‚Äã¬†@hedyddphillips7240¬† would you recommend to buy pixel 7 in 2024? I have always used low end and mid range devices earlier.
the a54 really has to offer something to be worth it..
Is it really that bad üò≥
¬†@Loverofallthingsliving¬† I don't think
what about screen quality ?
Can the battery will last for a single day or more than that ?
‚Äã¬†@jothistharianjacob1255¬†I just got the phone 2 days ago. Been only sitting at home with WIFI on. Easy 6hours screen on time while on social media and random surfing the internet. Not playing games though.
Mine will be delivered Jan 3rd!!! So I will have the 14 Pro Max and the google pixel 7 with a 13 Pro Max for a backup phone just in case
"Google products suck! Buy an LG, the most patriotic tech company ever."
"hopeful this Thing ends up like that windows phone,  IN DA LANDFILL   , .. LOL !"
"yeah now we can let google listen in on conversations, get those key words  LOL Nope  !"
What does it mean when a smartphone isn't available in a market/country? Does it also affect the phone's mobile data speed in a country where the phone isn't officially available?
A compact device this is not.. lol
I just want a phone that works and will last at least 3 years without glitching out and falling apart. Iphone is garbage
"I bought the Pixel 7 two months ago from the Google store and it has been a complete nightmare

While the reviews are definitely correct about the face unlock and finger unlock, there have been a myriad of other issues.

The most recent one, is that the screen does a bright flash and then I have no screen.

Google wanted to send me a remanufactured phone and I had to fight for a week to get them to replace it with a new phone.

The voice to text on the new 7 is really bad.
You'll also see a myriad of other issues that will annoy you to death. I would highly recommend staying away from the Google Pixel 7 pro. It is the worst phone Google has put out to date

I have owned the Pixel 2XL, 4XL, 6Pro and 7Pro. Without a doubt the 7 is the worst with the 4XL being the very best one."
give me a phone with a headphone jack!!!
I think when reviewing a pixel phone you should have adopted a different approach from the generic one and actually showed why pixel should be considered which is the machine learning capabilities and the software magic they have done to use hardware optimally. I guess it's only MKBHD who does that.
"DO NOT TRADE YOUR PHONES 
IN!! IT IS SCAM!
GOOGLE AND HYLA ARE
RUNNING A SCAM TOGETHER
ON BLACK FRIDAY PHONE TRADE-INS!
traded two phones into Google, my pixel 6, and my gfs iphone 12 mini. She got a pixel 7 and so did I. They sent me two identical boxes for the trade-in phones to be sent back. There was nothing that said this box should get the pixel, this box should get the iPhone. Both said my name, my address, same size box, same size cardboard inserts for the old phones to go in, nothing in the instructions said anything about being absolutely sure which box is for which phone Well since they were in the ""wrong"" boxes my iphone trade-in value was lowered to $234 from $459 and am yet to see how much they lower the value of my pixel 6 from $479. This is totally a scam and completely unfair. The only reason we traded in these phones was because of the boosted trade in values for black Friday deals on the pixel 7. My pixel 6 was perfectly fine."
the chin is just ruining the looks
picking up this phone soon
Just got this phone and I absolutely love it
"Total disappointment with the Google pixel 7 phone. The Wi-Fi disconnects very often. The fingerprinting sensor doesn't work. The battery is below average .  I was using  OnePlus 5  which I bought 5 years back had a much faster finger print sensor,  much faster charging , much better battery life . I cant believe , 5 years later Google came up with such a mediocre hardware. Android 13 is clean without bloatware but with bugs.   I was deceived by the rave reviews given by the so-called Star  reviewers of YouTube.
The selling point was that the Google tensor chip was better in terms of photo editing and voice typing with machine learning capabilities, but
I can't see any difference between the cheap $300 , oppo phone and Google pixel phone in terms of the performance of  the photo editing or voice typing.   I am  yet to see any feature where the Pixel phone with a tensor chip  outshines the midrange  phones with  cheap processors. 

Not recommended."
Actually one of the worst screens I've seen. Rainbow effect is terrible
"Funny, one of pix7 slogans is ""even better"".
Really?
I'm thinking that's not going to be hard.

They've got a hell of a job on their hands bringing back many formerly devoted clients after their last mess/ pix6"
"Hey! There's often another issue overlooked by reviewers. It is its 5G and 4G connectivity. Google has actually artificially blocked the phone from connecting 5G networks abroad, in countries they say they don't support. We know this because a simple root and module/patch actually allows the phone to connect to all 5G networks globally. Its not a big deal if you do not do much travelling, but if you travel a lot, it becomes extremely problematic. It has been the same with all pixel 5g phones."
Jesus Christ
No. Only the official service might be in question.
"I'm always curious, for what people gonna use it now, in 2022....?"
¬†@maksimb3706¬† for aux cables or wired head phones or any external devices. just to name a few
¬†@xtqu1ckx¬† Good to know.....)))
"Hello, how is it?"
"They were not very devoted then, and after last updates my pixel 6 is working fine.  I didn't have most of the problems I have read that other people have had.  Just a hard to set up fingerprint scanner.  But now it is a different ballgame. I can say I am having no problems right now. I am a devoted pixel fan.  Have had most nexus phones and three pixel phones.  I have also owned many galaxy phones and some apple phones over the last 15 years.  I don't like Samsung UI skins and feel the pure android experience plus nexus and now pixel updates are the best of the cellphone world."
"Hi, have you done this with your phone? I want to upgrade my Pixel but I live in Thailand. Trying to debate if it's still worth getting if I can't use 5G. And no idea how to root a phone lol"
"¬†@juicyfruit867¬† I keep replying to this comment, and the reply keeps disappearing.

I don't believe its worth acquiring a phone that needs rooting in order to work like a phone. I've rooted a past pixel because I got it as a present, as a necessity for it to function properly, however I would not buy a phone knowing that I have to root it."
"Does this only apply for 5G?  Or 4G, too?"
"¬†@ryancyt¬† Voice over Internet is screwed in many countries. 4g is ok but the phone has problems in unsupported countries and in general sometimes it connects better through LTE by default (even though it support the bands) rooting opens up doors to fixes and patches. Its not really worth the hassle though (unless ultour experienced, otherwise it's just really stressful). I'd say get a S22 ultra that's around the same price now as the Pixel 7 pro globally. Sure worse cameras and less features, but everything works and 5 year support."
"¬†@Paul_the_surfer¬† I see.  Thank you!  It seems that the overall experience with Pixels is very inconsistent and lots of ""YMMV"".
I am considering a Samsung flagship now.  Thank you again."
God this guy is a bore to listen to
I would prefer a Qualcomm version
"In nutshell, Samsung S22 is clear winner"
"The processor is not super fast but not slow by any means, the voice record is on the dot. Camera is great though that is because of Google's insanely awesome software. Decent for games and stays cooper than some phones out there. Sometimes it does get quite hot but it cools VERY fast. I give this device a 9/10"
"Is the battery of the pixel 7 better than the galaxy s10?
 And the audio is as good as in the s10?"
Where did you get that wallpaper? Great review
"Just picked one up yesterday, I can say I'm very impressed with the phone, but I do feel like brightness could be brighter. But other then that totally worth it. Updates are definitely slower installation time but I give it a 9.2/10 stars."
most people want bigger phones.... news flash. Google we want speakers that play at louder volumes and batteries that last longer.
Its all nice only the fingerprint reader is sad
Wow. You look very different in the selfie photos than you do in the video.
"I am extremely disappointed with the quality of the video camera in the Pixel 7. I had a Pixel 4A which i traded in for this one hoping for better quality videos for my social media where i make miniature figurines and film the process. Boy did i make a huge mistake...
The default video setting is extremely dark and needs to be adjusted manually before each take, OR have extremely bright lightin, but even then, most times the camrea will go automatically dark and shadowy for absolutely no reason!
Macro videos don't have the ability to zoom as well as the Pixel 4A even, everything around the center of the screen is completely blurred out and i cannot focus on small details of my creations as well as i used to with the old phone. 
There is also a huge problem with integration with other apps: 
In CapCut - the videos are dark even if i chose to film in HDR and different frame rates, it's like the videos are uploaded there in their original form... 
Instagram: I sent a video to a friend via instagram chat and once it was uploaded it was near black and white - completely pale, no colors! I think it's because i VERY slightly adjusted the brightness of the video.

And it has nothing to do with the phone's brightness, the videos are all just messed up and out of focus and it's ruining my creative process, i walk around sad all the time because of this stupid phone."
My wife has recently ordered mine and it's on its way early Christmas present. I recently dropped and cracked the screen of my one plus 7t pro that I have to say is an absolute amazing phone when it comes to all day usage battery life is amazing and you get almost fully charged after 35-45 minutes. I'm really going to miss it üò± I've had it almost 3 years and can't fault it. I'm interested and eager to see how I get on with this. Never thought I'd have such a sadness having to retire a phone. Haha it's been through a hell of a lot in those 3 years. Thanks for the review.‚úåÔ∏è
Free from blotware üòÇüòÇ...but not free from Googles blotware üòÇüòÇ
"Does the Pixel 7 support 60fps for third-party camera/webcam apps?

I have an Samsung S21 and one of the downsides is that it only supports 30fps for third-party apps."
"Hi, I am looking to purchase the regular pixl 7 on Black friday (¬£100 off) is this a good deal? [Bang for buck] i am coming from Iphone 11 which I bought in 2019 sept. I'm kind of tired of apple's UI and general ecosystem so I want to switch it up. The battery on it has declined drastically (Ofc I know why).  Main uses: general browsing, moderate use of applications such as youtube, twitch, netflix, spotfiy,  do not take photos/videos often, battery life is very important to me! I heard the battery life is terrible on both variants of the 7. So that might be a worry. I do not want to go back to Iphone even if they do have the superior battery life. 
Please help!"
Absolutely not an Exynos for power consumption.
¬†@GK-qc5ry¬† exynos gets really hot I hate exynos
¬†@GK-qc5ry¬† I buy phones with Qualcomm and it works really well but with mediatek and exynos not so good
"Yes, for double the price in the UK"
Updating the phone is a pain in the @$$. It takes around 40+ mins for every updates
¬†@akashebe6626¬† yes very annoying
Which phone have you given a 10 star?
"This thing was TOO bright in broad daylight on full brightness. I dunno what you mean, but to each their own."
‚Äã¬†@Dyl__Cam¬†to bright not a bad thing üòÇ most of my phones way to dim couldn't see it
Hey how is your experience so far can you give an update? Your fav things about it and things you dislike?
¬†@naveedhasan6738¬† i say after some use this thing holds up. Only con I have is maybe a better resolution screen
Updates are slow?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ You can't do something else for 40 mins away from your phone?? How addicted are you? üòÖ
"¬†@John-gt6xq¬† Weirdly I've had the opposite experience. Compared to the OnePlus Nord and iPhone 11, the Pixel 7 is noticeably louder and clearer with my Bluetooth speaker and car Bluetooth. 

Granted, all of my devices support AptX so maybe that's the difference"
"Not everyone does everything on their smartphones to demand bigger screens.

Louder speakers and bettee battery life? 100% yes."
I suggest the Samsung fold 4 for you.
Yeah the battery life on my 6 is decent but it could be better. Just bought the 7 so we'll see if it's improved. I'd just love a full day with heavy use.
"well great, but we have too many huge phones. I get that most people want big phones, but there are maybe 4 ‚Äûcompact‚Äú phones that are acceptable in the entire android phone market, while probably 150+ big phones. YOU HAVE ENOUGH CHOICE, NOW GIVE US SOME"
Does the pixel 7 have a NFC option?
I don't. I'm happy with a more compact. Who wants to lug round ultras with them everywhere
‚Äã¬†@blakeb9964¬†how did the 7 work out for you?? I've been tempted to pick one up now that they gotten cheaper.
Any update on battery life versus the 6?
"I personally don't want to carry a tablet in my pocket. People who prefer smaller phones don't have many options today, so I'm glad Google still makes thinks about those users."
"It's the charging speed y'all... 1hr 40 to full just ain't good enough, when mid rangers from China are crazy fast."
How was the battery life on the 7? ‚Äã¬†@blakeb9964¬†
can you tell me what charger you use?
‚Äã¬†@noahballs_6129¬†for the one plus I use the red fast power cable I use this for the pixel also which works a lot faster then any other cable I've used. I like the pixel camera is better . But nothing beats that old one plus I will definitely go back to OnePlus next year
Tell me which company charger you are used for pixel ??
They're great for the price. Rapid charging balances out the battery drain very nicely holy cowww is it fast
"Can you guys review on budget smartphone like Xiaomi Redmi Note 12S and Pro versions when you get hands on it, thank you! üòÑ"
Funny thing is the phone I'm upgrading from has smaller borders around the screen & it's a budget phone...(Nord N200 OnePlus)
"Phone software and camera are brilliant. BUT the screen is awful. Washed out, low saturation, off axis pink shift. garbage. Also still has a chin! come on google. And its a thick heavy phone. Iv been on oneplus 6 for years and desp for basically that phone with android 13 and better camera."
Can't stand the fake voice on this guy
no expandable memory?!
For me the 6a is more compact feel. And I think picture quality is close.  And I dont care about luxury things as wirless charching and higher refreshrate.
Those bezels are horrendous
I would've bought this phone if it didn't look like Krang's Android Body
"After they shift from Qualcomm to Exynos, camera quality became shite"
My pixel 4 XL has some better specs I'm debating on upgrading
Why have a 50mp camera if it‚Äôs not used. I‚Äôm confused ?
"Hi, can anyone tell me, where can i get the pixel 7 original charger?"
Replaced my s21 with the Pixel7. S21 had bad camera quality
I'm an owner of a pixel 7 and I've been having the WORST experience with mobile data for internet and phone calls. Literally doesn't work half of the time.
U don't have real phone mate
"I need your suggestion on iPhone 12 and google pixel 7, I am going to buy any of those mobile. Please give me a reply."
Iphone 14 review plz
"Get $100 off a Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 7, or Pixel 6a when you use the following code at the Google store: YY5FO4L34L4QD235YEHJWF9"
This guy's voice is too cringy to listen to.
It doesn't lol
It doesn't though. It's almost identical including the bottom which is slightly thicker. You're also getting an LCD and plastic easy to scratch back vs OLED and Gorilla Glass on the Pixel
It's for seeing though walls
Maybe it could be your service provider for issues related to the network or internet and not the actual phone itself. Try contacting your carrier
So strange and weird  that people are hate exynos in Samsung phones... but in Pixel phones they like exynos chip...ü§¶ü§¶
"Finally a regular Pixel 7 review.  I love mine.  It's lighter and smaller which makes it easier to handle vs 6.  Battery life is great. Finger print sensor is WAY better. works 90% of the time vs 10% of the time on my regular 6.   Camera is fantastic.  The phone feels just as fast as my 13 pro or S22 in day to day use.  Quit being a benchmark whore.  The ONLY issues I have are signal (antenna strength) seems to be lower than my other phones. and getting it to wirelessly charge is almost impossible unless you buy a google specific one from google.   But, all that said. it is an awesome phone.  I don't game, but do not buy a pixel to game on.  you already KNOW its not a gaming phone so don't buy it and then complain that it isn't the best gaming phone.   that's like people buying the iPhone 13 mini and complaining they aren't getting 2 day battery life out of the tiny Mini."
I've seen faster fingerprint reader. Question is where ?
"great phone , but that chin is damn ugly."
"Buy a pixel 6a,7,or 7pro and get a $100 Google store credit. B2BEFYSHO6KWPLF3M35E9BI"
I just got mine yesterday. Game changer.
Great phone if you can remove that stupid bulge on back
How about a review for the Nokia X30 n G 60
With the new EU ruling forcing tech giants to open their platforms I predict Google phones will become more popular as you'd just go for the tech rather than the seller

I am using the pixel 7 for a couple of days now and i find the phone heats up when i use the camera and photos app for sometime. I usually dont play any games so this is really strange my old oneplus phone did not heat up with such light usage.
I returned my 14 pro max and got this and can't be happier! Compact and value for money
looking forward to upgrade to pixel 7 from 6a.
Most of the people I see use tempered glass on their phones. And fingerprint sensor on Pixel 7 stops working with tempered glass. None of the reviewers had tested that.
bro ur channel is soo underrated
"The Pixel 7 is such a good deal as it is to Android what iPhone is to Apple. I've had mine since release and swapped from a Pixel 6 which I was a little disappointed with due to some minor issues after Google sorted out the bugs which plagued that model not long after it's release.
The Pixel 7 resolves so many of the Pixel 6 frustrations. It's not a phone boasting huge upgrades like many manufacturers, it's just a better, more polished phone. I've had no issues with the battery despite it being smaller, it easily gets me through a day with decent use. It's a phone that does the job well, performance is constantly good and smooth, call quality is very clear, face unlock works well and the fingerprint sensor is definitely better than on the 6. If you simply go by benchmarks you'll skip past this phone but you shouldn't. Going by Antutu the Pixel 7 is 14 places and over 55000 points behind the Galaxy S22 (Exynos). I had an S22 earlier this year and it is possibly the jankiest phone I've had, scrolling on apps often stuttered, didn't load properly, slow switching apps and loading etc... I ditched it off after 3-4 months. It goes to show that well matched software and hardware work better than just pure hardware power."
Thats because most people have no idea what theyre talking about.
I have the Honor 70 now tomorrow I will have the Pixel 7 have I made a big error......... Honor 70 has been a blast now it is when it came out it was update after update now they have it in the bag but I am changing not because of the phone it's due to accessories so I can use in the car and motorcycle.
That's the only drawback of this phone! I suspect tensor G2 fails in the long run! thats why for sake bought the pixel 6a at half the price of the Pixel  7!
"¬†@sasi_4395¬† Pixel is a software oriented phone, so a lot of issues will get resolved with software updates, November updates fixes some of them, also camera too will receive a update to improve what's lacking. I have upgraded from pixel 3a to 7 and was looking at 6a too, but in my opinion the hardware on 6a is a let down when it comes to using the device in the long run. Also, 6a is more refined presently in terms of camera because that camera has been a stable and perfected one from google because they have been using it for years while the 50mp sensor is a fairly new one. In the future though it is going to receive significant improvements."
¬†@percentbigfoot¬† I'm considering pixel 8 or above
"¬†@sasi_4395¬† Oh, then 6a is a good stop gap device, I think the 8 should be better enhanced. Also, I got my device recently and the initial impressions are quite good. It did heat up in the update process, but seems okay in the normal use."
"How fake can you be! I mean cmon man, a 14 pro max to a regular pixel 7 but no the pro. If You would‚Äôve said u bought a regular 14 pro and got pixel 7 would make up for what u quoted being compact. Anyways good day."
"¬†@bigmanrockin7327¬†  I have owned every iPhone model so it's no big deal for me , may be for you so shut your trap"
"Ok Richy rich, Suit yourself."
¬†@fijiwill2237¬† some people don't like enormous phones.
¬†@ThatLaloBoy¬† some people like bragging.
‚Äã¬†@bigmanrockin7327¬† not everyone is an apple fanboy or fan girl my best friend just switched from iphone which she hated to this phone which she loves
why should you upgrade?
It's too early bro. Just wait for the upcoming Pixel series then you might consider buying new one. Pixel 6a is still a top choice around other smartphones.
It's been 5 days since I've received the P7 and I am using a glass screen protector with no problems. I think it has to do with how thick the glass is.
¬†@MrPontiac005¬† Yes. It can be. I've ordered spigen (apparently google certified or worked together with Google). Will install it today and review again.
¬†@PrateekSaini¬† the one I have is AACL brand.
¬†@MrPontiac005¬† so I've been using spigen tempered glass for 4-5 days now and it's fixed the fingerprint issue on last tempered glass to some extent. It works 7/10 times. but still atleast once a day the scanner stops recognising my thumbs at all.
Interesting you say that. I experienced stuttering on the Google feed news app and in chrome? I had to return.
Samsung always been notorious for having such issues. Not surprised at all even though their hardware is better on paper. Software is another story.
¬†Netflix Entertainment¬† yes noticed android is not going to be a smooth as iPhones
¬†Netflix Entertainment¬† that's because the iPhone has a faster cpu. A16 bionic is the fastest chip in a phone.
¬†@kiavaxxaskew¬† pixel 7 pro is as smooth
When I'm watching video and I receive text notifications the notifications literally look like they're glitching.....
"Same dude I came from a Galaxy s21 and I felt ripped off from that software, I couldn't replace the bootloader either. I feel like I'll have this Pixel for years"
All  phones will  have  issues  there is  no  perfect  phone it'd just what  you  prefer.
"Dude did we have the same phone? I had to constantly charge my pixel 7 during the day. I was used to the finger print scanner failing 3 times and having to enter my pin manually, like I hadn't done that in ages... Signals for WiFi, BT and 5g were piss poor. So poor in fact I didn't have WiFi for example in my 1 bedroom apartments bedroom. I ditched my pixel7 3 weeks ago and switched back to my 4 year old LG G8s. What a treat!"
"‚Äã¬†@DutchDesires¬† seems like your device could have just been faulty, you're the first person I am reading who experienced such issues."
"I bought the pixel 7 due to all the hype of YouTube. I hated it and returned it. I've gone back to my old Samsung s9, eventhough the battery on it is old. The pixel had a lot of bugs, the photo quality was slightly better than Samsung s9 but for 4 year difference it wasn't that great. The quality of materials felt so cheap. You tap on the back and it feels like a cheap Chinese ¬£100 smart phone. Heavy too. I think Google is massively promoting positive pixel 7 reviews. It'll be a Samsung or iPhone for me next, but I'll wait till next year"
"Apart from the camera, even 300$ phones have way better specs than this crap ü•¥ and heard a lot of people saying that the tensor heats even during simple tasks... Kind of like those Exynos powered samsung phonesü§°"
The background music is awesome
"It's been 10 years , you guys still serving through your website"
Lol this sucks.
Compact? üòÇ
Thanks for doing this one too. Whenever a phone comes out im eager to hear more about i look forward to your reviews
I wonder why this is not as available as Samsung
The best compact flagship alongside Sony Xperia 5 IV üëåüèΩ
"Nokia X30 review, when?"
"Is this phone better overall than the S21 FE though? You can find the S21 FE at a lower price, and on paper the S21 FE has better display and camera specs."
Awesome review of awesome phone... Thanks GSMArena
i like the look of this phone
"It's a good phone but Google should be way more innovative, not follow the rest"
Peace Will ‚úåÔ∏è Great video as well ‚ù§
Nobody mentioned it being 64 bits and how it causes issues with some apps when trying to side load
"I've been waiting for this - you guys give an IMPARTIAL review, & I'm sure many of us appreciate that."
I  just traded in my S9+ for the P7 and really like it. I was going to get the S22+ but read on several forums about it being laggy and about the battery. Everyone has their opinions and experiences üëç
¬†@MrPontiac005¬† I wanted the flip 4 but there have been heating problems and battery problems in samsung so I went with Vivo x80. Too bad i really liked Samsung's UI but because of the battery bloating issues that is going on I rather pass.
"¬†@MrPontiac005¬† your pixel gonna be overheating in a few months, have fun."
¬†@fijiwill2237¬† you can really predict the future?!??!
You should consider getting the s21 fe for a phone similar to this one and that‚Äôs within the same price range!
"Pixel 7 can block out background noise, eg when you're next to a running tap. IPhone 14 doesn't do that, the running tap fills the the silence between your words
There's a review video on YouTube demonstrating this"
Who buys Sony phones üôÑ
¬†@josephpepe2607¬† I would buy them. If their pricing wasn't a joke lol
¬†@josephpepe2607¬† sony ericsson used to be huge
"Dude it's not compact, come on."
Nobody gives a shit about Nokia
Only display is better on s21FE
"I‚Äôm actually debating whether to get this device or the s21 fe, as they are both within the same price range lol. I currently have the s20 fe and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with it"
"And like, 0.01% of people side load apps. That would be like car and driver magazine basing their review of a car on how well aftermarket customizations work on it."
¬†@ElectricC0mpany¬† I don't think it's that low. Android as a whole is very friendly and sideloading is a highlight feature. And as long there's paid apps there will be a lot sideloading
So what should they do? Never switch to 64bit cause it‚Äôs an inconvenience for you?
"32-bit is old, it is slower and less efficient. Google asked developers to stop using 32-bit many years ago, and said in due course, like iOS, it will be banned. Blame the developer, not Google, as 64-bit in a techie device is the right move."
¬†@mickymac432¬† who are you referring to?
"¬†@andyH_England¬† Definitely not against 64bit  just I feel it was never conveyed that this particular device will be the stopgap of sorts for such. With so much coverage and leaks about it, this didn't come up and I feel that is something many would like to know prior to purchase."
¬†@odemata87¬† google.  Apple have changed to 64 years ago
¬†@mickymac432¬† Not sure if you're being a smart ass or what but what does Apple changing to 64 years ago have to do with my original comment?
¬†@odemata87¬† chill out bro. I meant Apple changed to 64bit years ago so not sure why you‚Äôre getting all angry about Google doing so. Jesus it‚Äôs just a phone man calm down lol.
"That's less than half of 1% of people, who cares"
¬†@venukrithish007¬† it definitely is that low
Which apps that you side load use 32 bit? How do I check what apps are 32 bit.
But still they don't provide a Manual Mode for neither Photos nor Videos.. that's definitely a bummer.. the only work around could be to shoot raw and edit in post...but that's limited to stills only !
"Very incomplete review, no ip68 under water test, no overheating test, no battery life performance real test. The best reviews actually come from real users."
Watching this on my Pixel 7
Sound test review
Which game was that?
I'm looking to switch from my S20 ultra to the pixel pro
Great review as always!
I'm seeing most people saying the pixel 7 battery life has improved but mine is performing the same or more likely worse than my pixel 6. It could be some weird inconsistency. I'm on Fi. It probably has something to do with 5g on Fi.
"Sounds like a robot
You could have done this review the day you got nothing different than what everyone else says"
I love the Pixel 7 in all ways except the just okay battery life. It's struggling to get 4 to 4 and a half hours of screen on time. Considering the size of the battery I was expecting at least 5-6 hours. Both the 5a and 6a lasted longer than the 7. Which is a shame since this is the premium phone.
"Thanks for the rewiev, still the best place for a honest rewiev ‚úåÔ∏è"
I don‚Äôt understand how it takes this guy two hrs to charge the phone. When I have the Pixel 7 and I charge it with the thirty watts fast charging brick from Spigen and it charges my phone in less than an hour and 15 minutes the most.
Why is it so hard to get charging right? Not crazy fast. But like under an hour would be nice from the big players.
"Best Camera, clean UI.... But I have to admit gaming wasn't even in consideration and SoC is rather wack. As an adult with a separate gaming PC and iPad Pro, it doesn't matter much to me tbh lol."
Great phone I prefer I've pixel 7 pro but aware battery is bad . But great phone
"I wonder, why most of the photos in your reviews are taken in Sofia, Bulgaria?"
Great Phone Thank you the review
"which phone should i get pixel 7, xiaomi 12t or the xiaomi 11t pro?"
"what do you recommend, Pixel 7 or Moto Edge 30 ultra"
I've never seen reviewers testing the things you listed on cam...they just tell you or recite the spec sheet it's up to you to trust their word or leave it
each of those are videos of their own. this review may be an hour long if you wish it to be that detailed.
Well I own a 7 pro and using the phone for videos lasts me about 14 hours straight. I dint test water since it's my new phone. And I'm running a case on it and so far nothing about overheating or anything like that
"These are actually specific videos. Usually not in the review, rather separated so unless you want a very long video you should be happy with it, this is how GSMArena works"
"Because all the things you named are very hard to measure objectively. Submerging test is useless, that's what certification is for. Overheating test is too dependent on environmental temperature. A test in Alaska would differ significantly from one done in India. Battery tests are done by GSMArena. There is no definition of ""real life battery test"". What may be ""real life"" for you (4 hours of mobile gaming) is meaningless to me (no mobile gaming at all)."
"Reviews don't do water tests, there are no ""overheating tests"" if it does overheat during usage they mention it and he did show results from their automated battery test they do on literally all phones so it's comparable to other phones. Idk wtf you talking about"
Then why bother watching
"His audience is not of hardcore users. More like people who are interested in getting a new phone maybe from a old iPhone, Galaxy, or even Pixel users. This is a great review for most people who don't care about the tests you are mentioning. Don't hare because everyone on youtube has thier audience."
"They can't, because of policy, I think"
You are a complete idiot. Literally go to their webpage for full reviews which are incredibly detailed
Never seen any of those tests on a phone review before.
"cant decide to upgrade to iphone 14 from iphone 12 or pixel7, advice?"
¬†@ygsga8371¬† different ecosystem can't suggest it's upto your personal choice
"I've been using it for the past 10 days and it has been an easy transition from my Sony XZ2, though it has its fair share of flaws it's growing on me."
"Could be something to do with the signal. Also, it seems Google's number one issue with the Pixels is quality assurance. There is huge inconsistencies in the phones that they ship. A lot of people will report an issue that others swear their phones never face. I've had two excellent Pixels and my current one, the 6A, has terrible screen quality. I didn't realize it before the return period was over because it's a backup phone."
"It is using an Exynos chip and modem and those SoC are known for QC variations due to lower yield than the norm. So if you get a good one you will get average battery, a bad one, well not very good, as per many comments on the net."
"Hmm, weird, I've had my Pixel 7 since the 13th of October and it's regularly given me 7+ hours of screen on time. Easily lasts me the full day with moderate use with 15-30% left by night time."
thats weird cos many people are praising it for its battery improvements
Ur seller ripped u off. He sold u a chinese copy crap.
"Oh great :/ I wanted to switch from P6 to a P7 because of the poor battery life. If it isn't better on the P7, I'll have to wait for Samsung"
¬†@thefightgame7543¬† that's not great
What the heck. My 3 year old OnePlus 7 pro still churns out like 8 to 9 hours of SOT
"I agree, on mobile data Im killing mine in half a day with 3 hours SOT. WiFi will maybe push it to 6 max."
Maybe your phone hasn‚Äôt read your usage pattern yet ? Generally pixel battery life improves over time.
"Make sure you have installed all the latest updates. Also, the battery should improve over time with usage."
¬†@1minuteofgaming596¬† no it‚Äôs the typical guessing game of whether you‚Äôre going to get a good model of the phone from Google or not. So many people had issues with their Pixel 6 phones last year while some people had perfect phones.
"Once adaptive battery function kicks in, the battery is really good"
4 to 4.5 hours? Bro your Pixel seems defective
"People don't like downloading battery apps, but some of them do work for me all day. I've been using them for years and after a whole day I'm at 40% with any phone."
¬†@thepanther543¬† I think the whole point there is you shouldn‚Äôt have to download a battery app. Google should better optimize their phones before release and do more quality assurance.
The Tensor is a rebadged Exynos which is probably why the power consumption is too high. A shame Google didn't use Qualcomm/TSMC.
"‚Äã¬†@kumarsajal8400¬† 
I agree with you, my One Plus 8 gets much better battery life than my Pixel 6a. I know the battery is larger? but it's running an older SD865.
No excuses Google, your entire phone experience can't be just cameras. I do not like the Tensor chips at all, SD8 gen 1 seems so much faster."
They mentioned 20w PD in the article for pixel 7
Because they build their phones for longevity. Apple does the same thing and only has slightly better charging speeds but far behind the Asian competitors. We've even seen Xiaomi reducing charging speeds on some of their latest flagships because the faster charging degrades battery quicker.
My oneplus 10T charges from 0 to 100 in 19 minutes
"It can emulate GBA, PSP, PS1, SNES, etc. just fine. Which has been the case for years now. It blasts through simple games while I'm in a waiting room and that's all I need. I've stopped caring about the absolute best of the best after not noticing much performance increases since the Snapdragon 855."
"¬†@GeneralChaz9¬† yeah it's pretty capable of running light games. As for PSP, it did struggle running things like MGS Peace Walker, idk. Tensor really shines in NLP tasks like transcriptions; really faster than other phones with no internet required. Snapdragons actually edge it out on the image side of things though."
Why not.
Go for the edge pixel phones heat up under heavy load . But if you want camera  pixel
Edge 30 man
"They aren't even in the same class lol 
If you were looking to buy 30 Ultra, you should have compared it with the Pixel Pro or iPhone 14 Pro."
"¬†@zimbabweancallofduty6861¬†
think also the edge 30 is better, I want fast Fingerprint, fast Face Unlock & Long battery life, and the Camera is maybe not so bad compared to Pixel 7 or 7 pro.
125watt charging to 30w is also nice"
Good for battleground games ?
Oneplus 10 pro or this for $200 more?
I would buy if it was under 180 grams but 197 grams is a brick stone ! I guess it's good if you want to protect your family from thefes!
"You guys are for me THE reference for years for smartphone reviews, also the photographic side is very good, with the comparo meter.... Keep on going strong!"
"Does the screen really feel plasticy??? I am still using the Xiaomi mi 9t. Needed a phone for casual use. I like this pixel 7, it looks modern and minimalist and the camera is enough ( always love gcam ). However I am waiting for s23 ultra and s22 FE. Will be getting this if the upcoming Samsung phones isn't that huge of upgrades of the current ones."
I'll buy this tomorrow. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Redmi is the best ever
Finally!
Samsung is still a better choice
good value for money
Stock Google wallpaper
I love one plus super fast speed demon!!!!
"Pixel 6a is 178g, might just fit your use case. Pixel 6 is even more mental at 207g."
Try phone 14 pro max lol
"S23 Ultra seems promising. If you aren't buying a Pixel for low light photography, you are better off waiting."
There won't be a s22fe
¬†@drill_fiend1097¬† what u mean? I thought pixel 7 has the best night photography?
¬†@ychu9432¬† that's what I said.
Why don‚Äôt you try iphone 13 or 14? Since you want a total package upgrade?
¬†@keithkirbyobillo4484¬† That's a downgrade.
"¬†@Abdulrahman11799¬† lol apple ecosystem still the best, im also a pixel 4a 5g user and iphone 12 user at the same time. Iphone is full package."
Go and chk in the showroom. Samsung is plasticy third class build quality. No where close to Google Pixel build quality is best in classüòä
¬†@drill_fiend1097¬† wrong comparison bro both are feom different price bracketüòä
¬†@ychu9432¬† yes it has best phn
¬†@keithkirbyobillo4484¬† hyped pixel camera is best
I whole heartedly love my 7 pro. üî•üòÄ
Tired of using Chinese phones... Feels privacy is a threat from Xi government.
Yah but but cameras are not that good
Apple is a better choice than Samsung.
This is a Samsung phone with Pixel software.
¬†@Red.exe7¬† not really. Sd processors are better and more stable. I love the pixel bloat free software experience but pixel phones have a lot of bugs and they get slow with time.
"¬†@tptppttptppt¬† Samsung gets slowed down over time too, Whats your point here?"
"¬†@tptppttptppt¬† The Soc and display is made by Samsung. From my understanding, only north America models of Samsung phones have the snapdragon chip."
"¬†@tptppttptppt¬† Pixel uses Exynos. Yes, some Samsung phones use SD, but they prefer to use Exynos whenever possible."
"¬†@Red.exe7¬† Not true. There are other Snapdragon variants, worldwide."
money for value good
¬†@tanthaman¬† peach best
¬†@tanthaman¬† i personally prefer pears but you do you
Buy an Apple and you'll get a Lemon
¬†@tanthaman¬† why?
‚Äã¬†@tanthaman¬† tell me about it.
