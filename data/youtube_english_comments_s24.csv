"Hi, please help.  Does anyone facing any videoplayback microstutters or frame drop in S24, I am facing the issue. I want to know if it is a software or hardware issue. And what is the fix."
"Does Samsung (S24) support using  DJI Mic2 transmitter as input source in its Camera app ?
I want to see the L R indicators to believe that it's recording via dji mic 2 not internal mic"
Never ever saw any tech video so ASTHETIC as yours 💪💪 Bro 🤜
I wished they added that xtra zoom to the 24 underdog.
"i came back to this vid to say s24 is a really great phone, id still want it even the s25 is out on the market"
although I'm late to the party but I definitely have to appreciate your video quality and it does belong to the top of the industry and even I prefer your video presentation than most of the go to yt channels
I m looking to buy a new phone after 5 year of owning my samsung a 71 great phone btw but just want a better qality video in 4k. Ive been looking t buy between the s 24 or s24 fe...... for me the size is very important because i own a 6.7 inch and thinking about the s24 making just not to......... but on the s24 the picture comes more naturally than the s 24 fe..........so I m still thinking.
Battery is worst.
Superb review! Feel like im watching a documentary rather than your everyday phone review. Subsribed!
Samsung should have hired you for the commercials... cheers.
7 years updates ??? Samsung is saying s24 is not powerful enough to run one ui 7 lol could you imagine in 5 or 6 years 7 years definitely wont happen
Got my 🎉🎉 S24 yesterday 😂
"My S22+ suffered the green line issue just 1 year plus and they refused to fix it despite this being a well-known manufacturing defect. Will be switching brand after being a loyal Samsung user since my Samsung S7. 

But I am so wondering why none of these big influencers calling out for Samsung for their lousy screens? Could we start to hold these big brands accountable for their mistakes and not let the customers bear the cost?!?!?!

PS: Definitely NOT planning to even consider getting S25!"
This is art
Battery life??
"I swich to s24 from redmi note 11pro, it was a big mistake, low battery performance not enough to half day of awerage usage, display is olmost same, no ir blaster, no audio jack, try wired samsung usb c headfones don t work until restart, tooo many options for awerage user, fingerscaner is slower then in redmi, when i place 28 euro worth display cower  fingerscaner stop working, i spend 100 euros for screen protector, silikon mask and charger, 25w supet slow charger. Dont buy it don worth it"
You people need to admit to yourself that smaller phones are a huge advantage and i would gladly buy s24 mini if it existed.
You have very stylish personality brother love from india keep rocking
This video is cinematography at it's finest in a mobile phone review.
Only time will tell at this point
Thank you my friend!
Thank you very much 😊
2 minutes in and i am compelled to like and comment. Such a smooth presentation.
"Brilliant elaboration, loved everything about the video. Subscribed. Hi, What is your insight for S24 Plus (The bigger one) ? Keeping the battery life in mind, slightly overusing the phone for social media consumption and lots of calling, will S24 survive the whole day? Pls reply and advice. I love smaller S24 but worried about slow charging/multiple time charging the phone while working."
Subscribed! Nice review ❤
Much love from Nigeria
Only if the s24 had the sharp edges as the ultra has :/
"Great video bro, some of the best production value I've seen on any tech channel!"
"Subscribesd the channel, because it is the only review with honesty, s24 is much cheaper and having a top class performance like iphone and ultra models of samsung."
"S24? - It is Underdog (bad, bad phone!) but as a conclusion you recommends it. (?!) Must be funny-funny guy in real life!"
"I've owned android phones since the first, the htc g1. Phones are tools. Either for work, play or both. 
Pick one that suits your individual needs and wants. For me right now I'm rocking the S24U and enjoying it. 😊"
"I ditched my iPhone 16 Pro to S24, I will say I make the right choice. The underdog phone with great fascinating features in it. So many fun things to play with and customisation as well. Smooth as silk."
"Great video, I have an S24 and an iphone 12, Google Pixel 6 and a S10e, I really should sell some of them but not the S24"
What music player was you using?
just wish they create a s25 ultra mini
8:08......very clear view from majority side very detail pin to pin🫡💯💥
That was funny . Screen is not for multitasking . It's small for even one app forget about 2
"I have a galaxy s23 and i love it. It's handy, very polished and premium in hand, display is great, telephoto lens in such small and good size. I fell in love with samsung for still making compact phones and not compromising on anything. Samsung should keep this on 🙌🏻"
Subscribed! Because I couldn’t answer that question of WHY NOT? 🤪
I love my s24 even with a bulky heavy duty case it's still more pocket friendly then most modern phones
"60htz in this price range is below normal and very slow display, it's 2024"
YouTube music
Glad you think so!
Hahahah this is the way! 🤣
 @ThisIsE  🎣
Hi bro.. where can get the phone case show on time 8:25 ??
Great review 😊
"The Samsung S24 is something I would buy one day.  The Samsung A25 5G 256GB and Samsung A24 4G 128GB  are both on my list currently I intend to put 500 GB SD Card in one and 1TB SD Card in  the other.  To be honest I have recently bought the Samsung AO5s and Samsung A15 4G  as i lost my Samsung A10 running for the bus. 

I do alot of Street Photography. Samsung SD Card inside my Samsung Phones and my Redmi Pad SE Tablet helps."
"Last time I used the S8 was disaster, after years, I'm willing to give Samsung compact flagship another go"
I switched from the galaxy A32 and it's a big upgrade from my old phone :3
Good phone i bought
"Hey man! Great informative content 👍👍  loved the way u presented each point!!

Just a query 
1)For better battery life which adapter would be better 25W or 15W

2)And the standard cable in the box which supports 25w, will it be ok if used with 15W adapter

Thanks whoever answers"
"my aim was s24 base version after my A8 got damage from water,, but sad life = no money :face-purple-crying:"
Haha what an awesome intro!
"No hurry, peaceful environment n presentation and superb analysis 
Good job
That's what people need
👍"
S 24+ is May favorite
What should we buy s23 base model or s23 ultra?
This must be the best smartphone-review on the planet....👏🏻😊!! Well done!!
"It's really funny when you think about it. 5-10 years ago there were 6 inches""tablet/phablets"" . Today, 6"" is considered ""small screen""."
When it comes to the REAL requirements.... S24 is the best for me 😅
I need it this video !! Now I'm decided 😁👍
I'm glad this phone exists. I hope they make a smaller version like an iPhone mini tbh. I just don't really use my phone for anything other than communication and the occasional photo when I don't have my professional camera with me.
I wish these phones had Qi2 2 but at the same time you're probably going to use a case so just buy one with Qi 2 capabilities. Only thing I wish these phones had was a digitizer to work with an Spen so I could use my tablet pen across the two devices. Side mounted fingerprint scanner would also be nice but is unlikely to ever happen as its seen as 'inferior'.
I have an iPhone 15 and I really want this phone
Love how close it looks like the iPhone
You should
 @ThisIsE  waiting for year end deals
I can see why
Thanks 😊
"Because the phone body size is the same as those 5 inch old smartphones, while old 6 inch phablets are as big as new 6.7+ inch phones. Not kidding, I compared my phone to a galaxy note 4 and it's smaller."
Maybe you want something new to try yet you seek the familiar
 @ThisIsE  exactly
How about heating issue? Did you face that? or anyone else?
Excellent review & amazing production and video quality 🔥🔥
You done got ya self a new subscriber sir. Detailed i ordered mines today. And this video made me not regret that choice. Thank you 😅
It's
I'm finally convinced to go for this device.
sadly it comes with horrible exynos processor in india
"I want to buy S24, which colour is more attractive?"
Your video quality is like the best bro!
"Great video !! 
I've got a question, what's the reference of your phone case at 2'50 please ?"
"how come the camera is rubbish now, Samsung usually has great photos but apple is doing better for the first time in years. does anyone know why?"
"I'm due an upgrade and my current phone is a super budget Huawei 11 Lite 5G. I've signed the new monthly contract and they let me pick up an S24 tomorrow afternoon from the phone store.

Going from a mid-tier budget phone to a premium flagship (low end out of the three) I'm hoping it will really impress me. I actually prefer smaller phones, I don't need the Ultra size, I want it to fit in my hand. Also, I'm not sold on square bevels."
This maybe off topic but can I ask which music app is that in 6:45?
The fact that the regular S24 alone will receive updated till 2031 is mind-boggling
Mkbhd is just overhyped..this is how a Phone should be reviewed
"I just switch from a big phone ( Xiaomi 11T Pro ) to regular Samsung Galaxy S24. The device is cool, fit in your hand and i can say i like the size so much! I got the Snapdragoon Version"
"Wow loved the quality of your video, so smooth and great editing.. They had this s24 on sale one day only here in Norway today for 400$, ordered it, hope I made a good deal with the price.. Getting it on Tuesday, can't wait.. Time to upgrade my beloved compact S10e ❤🎉😊"
Nope
Thank you very much!
I appreciate the kind words!
You probably won't get the snapdragon 8 gen 3 if you pay that much for it😅. The bad exynos 2400 is what you'll get.
"I prefer samsung s24 than the ultra because of the screen size
Man phone brands this days are making tablets and calling them phones
I miss old samsung s series like the s9 and s8"
bro this is the best revieuw that i ever saw on my life keep it up now im decided to buy s24 in marble gray i came from iphone 15 pro wich i don't like ios im a gamer so i prefer more android for tweaks😃
This is my first time watching your content and I have to say the quality and fantastic edits are unmatched. You gained yourself a subscriber that's for sure.
Which music app did you use in the video?
Going from the S23U to an S24 the nicest thing is not feeling your phone in your pocket because of how light and small it is. It's a freeing feeling.
Should i switch from a Iphone to a Samsung?
It’s not small but it’s compact. You can say the S24 Ultra are optimus prime of the autobots then the regular S24 is bumblebee 😁
"Just came across your channel. Clever presentation, informative and entertaining in equal measure. Earned yourself a sub."
"I switch from iphone to Samsung S24 Ultra and in 1 week I changed again to my iphone.
Very disappointing with android system.Apple system is 20 Years front"
Is it an good idea to buy s24 now or wait till the s25 cause its only 5 months away?
Wow thanks a lot man great m buying this now thanks bro❤
this video just increased my chances of getting this s24 by 200%
Sir please do a video of comparison battery life with s24 vs 15 pro
I have the ip13 pro max. Here because I’m thinking of switching to smaller phone. Don’t know if i should wait for ip16pro or this s24. Currently leaning more to s24
Great video. Thanks. Not that long ago 6.2 inch was considered big...
I hear you. I wish for smaller Pro devices.
 @ThisIsE  yeah if they make a samsung s24 ultra mini it will be super awesome
I appreciate the kind words!
"Wow, thank you!"
Youtube Music
The app is called Epidemic Sound.
True that
"It’s also a bad thing coz sometimes it’s so small and light, you’ll panick coz you coudn’t feel your phone on your pocket😂"
"U can, if u r multimedia consumer cuz there is no annoyed dinamic island on the screen hu hu"
I switch 😊and happy😊
Pretty much everyone once I post a video 😅
 @ThisIsE  the resemblance is just… Was like when did he start doing tech reviews. maybe you’re distant relatives
" @ThisIsE  Yes, good sir"
"Awesome, thank you!"
Thank you
 @ThisIsE  commenting from it hehe got a good deal here in California 699$ 256gb s24
Thank you
"Just found your channel for the first time ever and maaan you are easily the best of them all..
Struggle to listen to all other reviewers, you talk so we ordinary's understand. Big thumbs up!"
"""There's always a case for that"" , I would be proud of that one"
Best review of regular s24 ever !
That is not proper word enough for this beauty!😉
"The best and most prettiest phone i ever had is S24!🤩With the brightest display,perfect design and size!I have it in cobalt violet colour,and it's sexy!😍💜"
"""Slower charging means reaching those 7 years""
Fast charging is actually good for your battery, as unintuitive as that may seem (with some caveats). Don't take my word for it, look it up :)
Comparing Samsung's S24 charging speed with that of the S24+ and Ultra, 25W uses higher amperage than 45W charging, which generates more heat, which damages the battery.
45W charging uses lower amperage (and significantly higher voltage) to charge faster and cooler. This helps preserve your battery over time.
That said, higher charging voltages actually increase structural damage within the cell over time, but this is very subtle and slow, and does not damage the battery as much as heat from slow charging (at the voltages Samsung uses). There is a sweet spot, of course - if you jack up the charging voltage too much, it will damage the cell more quickly than slow charging would."
The kind of review for Samsung S24 that I am looking for. Kudos!!
"Its interesting I was having a hard time finding an honest review on the s24 alone. I want a phone small enough to fit in my gimbal, the pixel 8pro and S24 Ultra are too wide"
"120hz? ""of course it's 2024""..............apple been real quite since."
Grainy screen issue only affects the S24 Ultra? S24 base is ok?
intro comparison was cool with ultra.
How is the stereo speaker?
came for s24 review end up with life lessions
I loved the flow of the video ❤
"The 4000 batery only in paper in test iPhone 15 last longer , and all celebrities choose iPhone iOS than android china phone 😊"
I prefer iOS than android china phone 😊😊😊
"FANTASTIC VIDEO… Subscribed 🤙
Getting in 2-3 days this BEAST"
This video alone changed my mind on which phone to get
i see you like black aesthetics. from phone to room decor to tshirt and gadgets. it looks cool 😎
New fan here. 😁
It is pretty indeed
Thanks
Very very decent
I am glad to hear that.
Awesome! Thank you!
I hope it was useful
" @ThisIsE  it was, I'm likely going for the base model. Only problem is that it's Exynos in my country"
I slowly developed that because of shooting and continuity purposes
s24 should have sharp edges like s24 ultra as it will feel more premium and also look flagship tier
"I bought the S24, not just for the price, but the form factor! I don't like the massive screen with hard edges, I prefer a smaller phone."
ngl i hate no headphone jack
I have the S10e and the S24. I like the colors on the S10e. For me the S24 is just too bright. Does an anti-reflecting protection screen help? Anyone have experience with that?
"The Android is better than the iPhone because of vpn and av , if apps used Face ID logins instead of thumb print sensors then the Android could easily beat the iPhone"
Loved this video so much! Definitely getting the S24 after watching this. The actual dark horse is this channel! Wish you all the best from the Dominican Republic!
Switched from iphone 12 mini to s24.
Thanks man.I think i  just gonna buy s24 for myself 😅
Amazimg video new subscriber earned.
Really 😮 60htz
"To be very honest I don't subscribe. But at the end of the video, I subscribed because I was quite impressed with the creativity of the video."
One of the best S24 reviews I've ever seen. Congratulations
This video made me even more wanting to switch from S22 Ultra. It's been a great phone up to even now but I am not a fan of curve screen.
Hands down the most creative review. I loved the introduction!
Superb Work. Cheers...!!
"Amazing details covered, amazing video quality, aesthetic than most out there, video quality top notch. Got a subscriber more."
I have a samsung s23 at the moment and went to the store to check out the s24. The quality of the camera is worse.  Even the S22 had a better camera compared to the s24. S22 and S23 had the same vibrant color and the s24 had is more kind of grey
Thanks for subbing
Not sure what htz is 😉
Thank you very much!
I am glad you enjoyed it
"Wow, thanks!"
Thanks!
"Wow, thanks!"
Thank you! Cheers!
"I came for the phone.. but i have to pause for a while because i had to say : ""The production quality is SUPERB!!!"""
"120hz display ? It’s 2024 man, of course 
iPhone 15 : hold my beer 🍺 😂"
The Plus is right up there with the physique of the S24 regular and the size of the Ultra.
"It's 2024, man, only iPhone 15 is stuck at 60 Hertz."
"I have the S24 Ultra, and I love it, but I can't feel comfortable carrying it around, so I bought the S24 as well, and I'm so glad I did. It fits so well in my palm"
Insane video quality and production. Subscribed
using s23 and loving it 🥰
"I am actually switching from the Iphone 15 pro max to the S24. 
the apple eco system is great but its not lol."
"The phone is great but no i realy wish if he has at least a 45w fast charger , that's would be amazing and makes it the perfect phone in the market"
Enjoyed the video. Such a high quality video and a very honest review. New sub!
Wallpaper?
U deserve a million subscribers ❤
How abour gaming on exynos on s24?
"I LOVE this video, had my s23 ultra for over a year now and coming from an s21 ultra I just can't put it in my pocket comfortably I'm usually holding it and may consider an s25 non ultra if they bring snapdragon back to uk next year"
Loved this perspective on the S24. Great work!
"The way you make your review and content is quite refreshing and really enjoyable. It instantly made me want to subscribe to your channel, and I did! Keep up the excellent work!👏"
The people who bought the S24 base model; basically got away with a  crime. I bought one for my wife with the Snapdragon processor and 256 G of storage. I cannot believe how masterful that compact machine performs.
You have vibes of Hollywood actor James McAvoy ..
"I just have changed from S23 ultra to S23. And after one UI 6.1 update, S24 and S23 are almost same. 
The only thing I miss from S23 ultra is more ram, and yes many times you will feel that extra 4 GB ram matters. 
Why I changed from S23 ultra to S23 ? As told in video itself, it is liberating to use small size phone with out much hustles. 
And during my encounter with S23 ultra for 3 months, I hardly used S pen for 3-4 times / week, so lately I feel, when I have my S8 tablet; I don't need S pen in my mobile. 
Except for zoom lens, I don't think I am missing much. 
Thanks."
"Trust me, it's not a big deal"
Thank you for the kind words!
You can check out my website for that: https://thisise.tech
Thank you
 @ThisIsE  very welcome i have the regular s24 best phone I ever had I have had many phones. Your review is unbiased and upfront. Most reviewers are nit pickers 😂
Much appreciated 🙏🏻
It’s a great device
"For what do you use so much ram that it literally starting to feel like ""you need 4gb more"" ? Thanks for an answer."
" @mikedecem  on go video editing and picture editing sometimes and using software to view radiology images. I mean when other apps are open in back ground, that extra ram helps. Other companies are giving 16 GB RAM for even lesser amount of money, but then it won't be this small phone."
"the only thing keeping me away from getting it is the Exynos chip :face-purple-crying: thats why im thinking about getting the s23 cuz its perform better but still, s23 over here is just like 50$ cheaper so idk"
"Hahahaha, ""Estás en lo correcto"" XD, what a great intro! And I also loved the ""With a little asterisk"" part (Where you actually put a little asterisk on the table) XD. great video mr. E! God bless!"
No memory card !!
"Just imagine s24 . Launched with 
Gorilla g Armor
6.3 inch display
Snapdragon every where

🤌🤌 i would have taken it for a 1000$ dollar without a blink❤❤"
I subscribed from this video. Great content and glad I came across you.
I believe Samsung should start paying you for putting together this perfect video of S24.
"Appricate sumsung for your wonderful work in terms of size, screen, performance and all.

I have been using regular S23 since from last year and I am in love with the device, It is fantastic device with small size product. As I got the lastest update of oneui 6.1 last year and it give me so smoother experience so far!"
Watching this with my S22 Ultra and I can say this is the best phone I ever had its like carrying a portable mini DSLR.
Best review I’ve seen comparing the 2 ty
Would really love a mini s24 but the exynos chip is a huge turn off as I had that in s21 fe & battery life was horrible.
3 minutes into the video and i had to subscribe the quality it is astonishing.
So its worth getting the s24 with exynos or should I go for the S23? My first S phone from Samsung
"Watching from my S23... Coming from Pixel 4a, 6 Pro, 6a and 7, I could say I'm glad I shifted to Samsung. The S23 is a solid performer, it's a beast killer!"
Can you make Vlog about connecting wirelessly Samsung Dex to PC
If i have money i will buy all the S24 and S24+ in the world. Prepare to suffer your worst nightmare.
"I have an iPhone 12 and am considering an upgrade. Should I get the S24 or the iPhone 15? I have an iPad and an Apple Watch. I don't mind losing AirDrop because the iPad can still be operated with Type-C port devices, but my Apple Watch will undoubtedly be wasted, despite the fact that it is still functional. Please let me know whether I should update to the iPhone 15 or the S24."
"I don't know why I am watching an S24 review video. I mean, I already have an S23 and an iPhone 13 Pro. 😅 I'm fine with both, but it's still good to be up-to-date on the new phones.

I've just installed the latest One UI update that gives some of the older phones the AI features.

It's good. The translation and the interpreter seem amazing. I hope the interpreter has an icon, so I could just press it whenever I need to, instead of going to the settings and finding the feature. 

The bad thing is just that Samsung has removed the settings to replace the homescreen gestures into the slide. Now I have to keep the icons or use the gestures, which is not as good as on iPhone. 😢"
wait 6 more months and it'll drop to $600
He put a physical asterisk by yhe phone!!😅😅
"No, no memory card."
Note 10 had the the peak display size of 6.3 inches with SPEN!!!❤❤❤❤
​​ @IronLad  watching this from note 10🤣🤣🤣
"feel free to go with s24. S24 exynos lasts longer compared to s23 with sd8g2 (around 1 more hour). And dont worry about it, its perfectly fine and smooth phone :)"
"I got the s23 256gb and a s24 (exynos) 256gb, i'm trying to buy a samsung s24 snapdragon with 512gb from the samsung hong kong store. But its hard to get this to europe"
"definitely the iphone 15 since you already have other apple products, that will be difficult to shift to android"
"Don't sell iPhone 12, Buy second hand S23 ultra and use it for your travel log and use iPhone 12 as back up or secondary phone. It will serve both purpose. And you are not going to spill much money. You can get second hand S23 ultra around 65-70 K INR. I think you are living in India only."
i got an Onyx Black for $500 off marketplace.
Why not 🙂
"Well said. And DeX is better when used with this device, in the sense that ""compensates"" easily (monitors and displays are everywhere) the small screen for productivity - I use it in a 60"" screen."
Bought the s24 and you are dead on point with the usability of it. Perfect for me
Man you are making content that people can really enjoy. Wow every small detail has so much fun 😊. You make Tech really Fun ❤
Shouldn’t you be comparing Apple iPad to Samsung Galaxy S8 or S9 Ultra Tab. I think some of the problems you listed in the video will go away with a more capable HW.
It looks like an iphone....
Wow! I have never see a presentation video like that! ❤
The 15 pro is amazing
"I’m an apple user, I have an iPhone 14 Pro but I’ve been really tempted to switch over to the newer Samsung galaxy lineup! Great video! Just recently discovered your channel you’re an awesome reviewer! I’m curious to know what do you prefer apple or Samsung devices?"
Great video you earned my subscription which I don't give easily especially with the tech YouTubers there are way too many clowns posing as tech YouTubers. You know it's bad when I know more about tech then most of these tech YouTubers and I'm older and do not consider myself a tech nerd smh.
Amazing honest review🎉
Great video ❤ can’t agree more with you
"i just wish samsung makes the base model with same ram and charging and chipset as the ultra, i just want the premium specs in the small phone"
reviewing s24 and stil use mac os and probaly iphone gg
okay this is more enjoyable phone review to watch than all I've seen from the other yet😊
I like small phones the most as they are quite easy and compact to use. But why do they make smartphone really expensive 😢
I love your videos. Simple and enjoyable to understand. Samsung are like my 2nd fav company. 1st is Apple.
Subscribe cuzzzz whyy not ❤❤❤
Your content production is good for growing channel.
Exynos is the only problem
Great times
Thanks a ton!
 @ThisIsE  keep up your brilliant works mate 💜
It's a great device!
Thanks for the kinds words! The answer depends on the surrounding items.
I appreciate the trust!
Thank you very much!
Don't we all
I agree. Would love the S24 with 12/16 gb ram. This is why I'm leaning towards Xiaomi 14
" @-fredo-7283  for what do you need 16gb of ram ? Thats a lot even on PC for most of ""basic"" consumers. I have s24 and never run out of the ram yet."
Go for the Sony Xperia 5😊
" @hebbersaldanha9834  The pen, the extra cameras, the heat chamber, the titanium frame? i just want the ram and chipset and maybe charging in the smaller phone no the entire phone"
"While I respect your opinion, 45 watt charging on a 4000mah battery is kinda too much imo"
 @anthonywilliams9415  You live in America?
"I mean they do have the same Chipset in some places, the S24 either comes with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 (Same as the Ultra) or the Exynos in countries outside America, which is a bit weaker, also there are some S24 Variants that come with 12 GBs of Ram"
"Wow, thanks!"
"Samsung just released their new A series, which are great offers."
Oh yeah
Thanks!
"I bought iPhone 15, then almost after 30 days got overwhelmed with youtuber videos regarding to S23 and  switched to Android. Trust me you ll enjoy Samsung S series but you ll miss face id and the visual feel of apple always."
You speak facts 💯  love from India 🇮🇳 ❤
I love this review. different kind of review and relaxing.
"For the compact phone lovers, apparently the base samsung s25 will be 6.36inch😮"
The only problem why i have switch to s24+ from s24 just because of the ram. I can't believe in 2024 Samsung still stick with 8gb ram and not enough for me with a non gamer's
"S24 super phone, but this Exynos for Europe is not good."
I go for s23 instead because exynos has a bad reputation in the past and rumors that AI will be supported in the s23 series
"1st time watching your videos.  I like the style and layout. Agree on the s24, the ultra is just too big. I get why people love the ultra, but 1 handed operation and fitting in my pocket takes priority."
"Thsi phone with snapdragon.... i am impressed with the phone. 

Its pmly the 3x inconsistencies i hate. 

I always end up using yhe pro mode to use the wide only for 3x or 4x zoom for good quality. But again that tales away the processing. 

The 3x is not great in nothing but full day light. There is always something dull compared to the main sensor"
"Love that you are covering more android phones these days E, keep up the great work the video is cinematic as heck! :)"
I was gonna get the + but I got the ultra cheap and the screen plus camera got me
Amazing production enjoyed the watch. Subscribed! 👏
Turn off RAM plus and you're good. Exynos will surprise you in terms of emulation. :yougotthis:
if I have galaxy S21 would you recommend to upgrade to S24?
This is a great video! As somone who always uses the smallest version for comfort while not sacrificing power you nailed pretty much all of my thoughts. Only question is where you got that clear case for the 24 ?
Mine got hot during video calls
Great Video👌👌
Watching this video on my S24 with a crappy camera.
Thank you
Thanks 😊
There are multiple companies with 8GB of RAM for their base flagships
 @jordanjackson8873  which companies?
@jamesluke4902  pixel and samsung. The iPhone 15 starts off with 6GB ram
Thanks! Will do!
Android is underrated. I have used iPhone once but never switching back to iPhone again. Got the best experience with Android.
"3 generations later, you'll notice a difference. If it works for you, however, it's not a necessity"
Thank you! This is actually Samsung’s OEM case which I don't recommend.
" @ThisIsE  good to know, usually haven't bought stock cases from them 😅"
Which app did you use?
What do you mean?
"Don't hold your finger for the lens, the pictures will be bad😂"
You should review OnePlus 12 as well. What a great review. Makes me want to get the S24
"Great video ! 💯
But what do you think of 
Pixel 8 vs S24 (ignore storage)"
Too bad that the post processing on the s24 line up is trash......
"Make it just a millimeter thicker so you can give it a slightly bigger battery, and give it the 1440p phones of this size used to have. There's no reason for them to be 1080p other than battery drain, but even that's a misnomer since phones have had them before and lasted the whole day.
That's all I really want. If the phone was even more miniature, I'd say 1080p is fine, but a 1440p display and larger RAM count are the only things that separate this from its larger siblings. I'd love to have both, but I'll settle with the sharper display."
S24 is so smooth but the quality of your video is smoother
❤ my s24! Unfortunately I'm not dedicated to the Samsung keyboard which I should be but I enjoy using Google and Microsoft SwiftKey as well.
"Just ordered the s24 EU, coming from s22. I'm used to the battery ( setting on 80%) charging at night, no problem. I upgraded for the 7 years of updates. I'm a light user, so the chip is no problem for me. In the beginning,  I will definitely be playing with it, but soon enough, I will use it as normal (for me). My galaxy watch is due  for an ugrade too. 🤔😅"
You’re right I subscribed why not great review 👍🏻
Phone of the Year s24 and I have it
"I don't care about titanium, give me more battery. and that anti-glare amazing screen"
Love my S23+ right in the middle of the regular S and ultra.  Perfect for me honestly.
Both phones have Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy
The battery even on Exynos S24 model is amazing. It is way better than i was expecting.
Nice intro btw
Paired up my Galaxy S24 with the Galactic Odyssey. Amazing color on the screen. Also purchased the Mag Ez Case.  Great review
I would say the s23 is better than the 24
This channel and its content is just 🔥
"I went with the S24+ because I watch a lot of content on my phone and its been great, traded in my Pixel 7 pro and couldn't be happier"
Great phone but thought of upgrading from S22+ but didn't because of Exynos. Will wait and see what S25 has to offer.
Would be great if you make a comparison between the s24 plus exynos Vs S24 Plus snapdragon.
I'll keep that in mind 🙂
I haven't had any experience with Pixel devices in general so I can't really compare them.
" @ThisIsE  Oh ok.
No problem buddy 👍"
"You don't know it yet, but the anwser you are looking for is: s24😅"
Pixel 8 battery is a joke man...
 @davelaymon6282  I can't give up on the camera 😶
Not sure it is that different tbh
Isn't that the dream phone of everyone's favorite device 🙂
you aint gonna spot the difference if its 1440 in thi size. We are still on 1080p on notebooks which has way bigger screens and its perfectly fine.
hahaha...that's a great compliment
even smoother than last time!
I was about to say the same
You just got yourself a new subscriber 😊
"Because of Samsung, I switched to Swift on my iPhone"
"Big mistake redmi note 13 pro + is way better, samsung is only owerpriced brand , but you may be used to be owerchatged for less, i hawe s24, and next time i will buy redmi"
Thanks for the sub!
Good choice for picking the phone of the year 🙂
It's a solid choice for a large phone
My 24 is Exynos
"the same for me, in everyday use, there is no difference between the Exynos and the Snapdragon, only if you go to the limits, then you likely have a difference in battery."
Thank you 😊
Super happy to hear. Thanks a bunch for the support!
What's galactic oddysey?
The wallpaper he was using he has them linked in the description.​ @Flash363 
The fuck is galactic odyssey?
​ @Mrcool179  a journey through the galaxy
​ @ThisIsE ...snapdragon
The two phones are almost equal except the chipset and the camera's colour tuning where s23 comes at a lower price
😊 thanks
You didn't like the Pixel that much?
"Even with Exonys, it's still a great device"
"Don't intend to buy the plus,  but thanks"
"I saw this video for aesthetics, what a production quality"
Very good video. Thank you for reviewing the base S24 as most videos are on the ultra.
"I upgraded to the base S24 from my S20 FE 5G. I'm definitely gonna miss it, but the S24 has been great, even though I'm pretty sure it is Exynos in my region (Australia)"
"Outstanding review
First time watching your review & I subscribed immediately after this entro"
If only it had the Snapdragon 😂 this would have been Gold
Hey IOS USER WAKE UP....ANDRIOD IS 4 YEARS AHEAD....😂😂😂
I couldn't live with the lacking UI/UX of iPhone. Just the wildly inconsistent back navigation is enough for me not to consider the brand.
That scenario… just sick! ❤
Excellent video! Congratulations on the quality of your productions!
Well-rounded phone.
So does the middle lense house the 50mp and 12mp camera? I noticed when cleaning my lenses with a cloth if i switch between 12 and 50 its the same middle lense?
For mee iphone is the best ever
"I have an iphone 14 PM with a cover and a glass protector, it's around 300gr total. You can feel my pain. 😅😅😅  As much as i love compact phone and this s24 especially, i do still prefer battery life and a bigger screen over weight and one hand usability. Beautiful video as always! 👏"
"This is 2024, come on Apple!"
"S22, S23 and S24 are beast!!!"
Production quality has significantly gone off the chart 👏🏼. Would you recommend this Dark Horse for a life long iPhone user?
I’m a small phone fan and switched my Pixel 6 to the regular S24. I got to say it’s fascinating. The balance between size and performance is great. Honestly this is my first Samsung device and it gave me a deep impression.
Thank you very much 😊
My pleasure!
Thanks 😊
Why would you miss the FE?
So where are you currently? You got snapdragon version?
Thanks
Still not sure what the goal for Exynos is...to replace Snapdragon at some point...or just to cut costs
Not really
The more I use Android the more I am starting to understand your point
The middle lense is a 50mp sensor and in the camera settings you can select to save pictures from the main lense as a 50mp file or the processor can use pixel binning to save the picture as a 12mp file
Thanks for helping with the response
Because you have limited experience with other brands.
What else have you spent time with?
Exactly 2024 and you text with green bubbles
​ @gagewyant7886 thats an apple problem lol
"I am very careful recommending as it all depends on app usage and device ecosystem. As a standalone device, it's a great phone."
​ @senty1568 It's one or the other
" @senty1568  in a everyday use scenario, there is zero to none difference, only if you use the phone to its limit you will notice the battery differene. Performance is close to the same."
That's because Galaxy is 3 times better than Pixel.
"sorry to hear that,your phone will start lag in 6 month top with that exynos shit
cheers"
"Im a fan too, i just switched to iPhone 15 when it came out"
How does it feel in your pocket? I got a pixel 7 and I hate it. I had to switch back to my pixel 5. Looking at this too.
S24 is in no way a small phone.
" @brokeguy5607  its compact i guess, tbh its the smalest size for a 2024 flagship"
me too. I switch in trade in my old pixel 5 to s24. Recive good deal)))
For me the same. I changed my trusted Pixel 6 with S24 and so far I am so happy with it. Amazing phone (my first Samsung as well).
" @firedave9822  unfortunately, I'd like to disagree 

I can't speak for the s24 specifically, but I have dealt with years of overheating issues, constant lag and freezes with previous models s22, s9 plus.
S21 ultras 

And the worst one being - wifi 

The wifi Chips are absolutely abismal and I dont see people talking about it ever, not a single mainstream reviewer on YouTube. 
By wifi chip I also mean 4g 5g lte service outside the house 
Exynos line should be dropped entirely."
What’s the Sot are you guys facing any heating issue?
"​@praveen2959  I just upgraded to 24 2 weeks ago, I'm from southeastern Europe so we get the exynos 2400 chip. I get around 5-6 sot in a very sunny day where screen is max bright. I also use the protect battery option which only let's me charge up to 80%. 

Just got  a simple non slippery rubber case, sometimes I game COD warzone but you can choose what you want in options like fps and graphics or battery and temperature. If I max out the res the chip is far ahead than my snap dragon 860 in performance and smoothness I can feel the 120hz working perfect on cod. On this mode yes battery drains big time and gets hot but I don't mind it, once you close the game no lags or stutters on phone. 

I was watching all this youtube videos boasting the snapdragon, I'm not happy that we get less in power at same price but exynos 2400 this chip is not to be bellitled.

Personal cons: I use 5G network and 2-3/5 bars signal, I put it on 4 g again 2-3 bars some very rare locations might go up 4 bars, but never seen full signal. 

Mobile data and calls incoming/outgoing are good tho, so other than the empty bars not much difference. 
 
When downloading apps, downloads in 2 sec but takes like forever to install like solid 30-60 seconds, where I'm used to my poco x3 pro installing them before download finish lol.

In terms of battery I can't complain I go from xiaomi to samsung and xiaomi has best battery efficency and charging, this small s24 fast charges in 30 min to 80%. 

In terms of display quality I'm very happy and I like the look on this, the design itself is clean and nice. 

I didn't think k twice between pixel 8(was also interested) and s24 samsung went for 24 and I'm happy, I like small phones and I dislike apple as I pirate most of every app that exists so for me was best choice."
"​ @brokeguy5607 WYM? S24 is a nice huge display 6.3 inch, that is perfect for using with a single hand and when compared to my previous 6.7inch phone is tiny and weights at 167grams."
"Does the samsung has a significantly better battery life? I’ve been using a pixel 6 too since launch, and thinking about upgrading to either a pixel 8, or the s24. My last samsung was an s8 so it’s been quite a while"
I bought my s24 today and wow i must say im very impressed even is it that exynos chip it does the job done and i never going back on a another phone till my phone die!😅
 @FanyKondaris  im in the Caribbean region but i git my s24 last Saturday but that section in setting display with the (HDQ Screen resolution) its no where to be found 🤔🤔🤔 samsung sell these ohones but alot of stuff we not seeing..
The screen is 1080p you can't lower or set the resolution higher. ​ @watchnoface_ 
Im a small phone fan too. Swapped my samsung s22 ultra for iphone 13 base model last year for abit over a year now. On the weekend bought base model s24 and its so good. I feel the ultra and the pro max to big. Base models perfect. Rocking both ios and android now
"Sold my 16 pro max cause I was tired of apple, didn't want a huge phone again so I bought the s24 and I gotta say this phone is so cool, love the performance the size, have never had a Samsung phone before and I don't think I will go back to apple anytime soon"
Great video as always. I really appreciate your work and the result is always amazing. Keep it up 👍
"How about multitasking on Dex? I use it a lot, and no one adresses it on reviews, I'm afraid exyNOs can't take it properly"
"For sure, the base models are seriously underrated. My wife switched from the s21 ultra to the s23 base model, and she won't stop saying how amazing it is every chance she gets. Nice review. I think more reviews of smaller size phones need to be out there before we people by ourselves kill small phones like MKBH stated. Again, this is a nice and intuitive review. 🫡"
"My friend its 2024 of course with that price you'll get higher refresh rate than 60







Iphone 15 watching in distance : 🗿🗿🗿🗿"
Good video! what would get you to ditch the iphone E?
whats that keyboard E?
different kinda tech review. loved it
Love from SA🇿🇦
Great review and aesthetically pleasant video to watch 👏
"superb vídeo. Although, Just want know, 14 PRO MAX vs S24 plus maybe.. ? What you think.. And thank you in advance!"
Much Appreciated as always!
Thanks! 🙂
DeX is awesome and such a relief to know you have.
I really appreciate it!!!
How's the battery
"Yo, here's a few things I've been thinking about:

- Samsung should totally make their apps work on computers, like Samsung Notes on Windows or MacBook. That'd be sick!

- I wish there was a video conferencing app that's as good as FaceTime.

- We need a universal sharing solution that's like AirDrop, but better.

I've got a few other ideas, but those are the main ones for now."
"I understand.

By the way, most Samsung apps are available on windows, expect for Samsung Notes which used to be available on all windows PCs but they decided to restrict it to Galaxy laptops for some reason, which is a bummer. @ThisIsE "
Better watches? Because I tried Samsung Watch 6 Classic and it’s awful… My AWU2 is far far superior
IQunix...not sure the model on top of my head
I want to visit SA someday. Thanks 😊
Super happy to hear that
"Your choice depends on the rest of your devices. If I have to choose solely based on the device itself, I'd say S24+"
