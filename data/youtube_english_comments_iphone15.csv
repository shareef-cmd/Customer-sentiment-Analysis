I decided to go with the 15 instead of the 16 figured the 15 would be just as good as the new one I didn’t wanna my bill being crazy high
aren't you that dude who make cars review??
"In terms of colours , I prefer black"
"Bro, unable to transfer video files which are recorded in slowmo or cinmeatic, to DESKTOP PC. Those folders are not visible after connecting the PC? Only Normal Video mode recorded files are visible. Feels like I did a mistake by buying iPhone. It has a lot of headaches. Can you help me in this please?"
Perfect phone but refesh rate is the only bad think for me
I’m upgrading from an iPhone 11 to a 15’ saved a couple hundred bucks but damn it’s fried having to just get it for the c charger even tho you’d expect the display would be better not saying it’s not an upgrade
I’m upgrading from 13 to 15 just seeing what the hype was about
watching this on my iP15 Pink ❤
I counted the word “LITERALLY” around 27 times 😅
"Just got it 🥹, huge upgrade I had a redmi before"
8:57 Don't waste water like that bro come on..........
"Hey  @mkbhd  , you mentioned notch here and then they created 16e. 🤣🤣🤣  HU R U?"
How’s the over heating issue?
"Heyy MKBHD, do you perhaps have a spare one of these phone please, would really appreciate it, if you could bless me, love the videos🎉"
Mr Marques pls send me an iPhone 15 🙏🙏🙏 pls the base model pls
You need to get a Job asap
it ain't that hard to predict.
"I never had an iphone before and honestly about 90 Hz and more Hz i dont really care, i understand the phone its expensive and whatever BUT, i have had phones with more than 60 Hz and i always lower it to the default settings because it just feels so unnatural, i love this phone, its a good at everything phone, and i got it with a huge discount so im not complaining for what I paid for really good phone"
So should I bay 14 pro or 15?
He predicted the iPhone 16e
is this phone still worth buying now? i'm considering to switch my 5-year-old android...
4:42 how you do that
Who else is watching this on repeat?
Has Apple still not solved the cooling issue?
Smartest tech brother on the tube!!! Love your content sir
Can't wait for the iPhone 17! Better hope 120hz is standard by then..
iv had a pretty cheap samsung for years but now that im in highschool my parents gave me an iphone 15... never have i been this happy with a piece of tech
Just upgraded from a 11 to a 15
"If you want to be  good with the 60Hz, just stay with it. Please do not, and never try/use any other 120Hz for a day then back to 60Hz :))) it is my real experience"
Battery life sucks. Drains fast.
MKBHD ahh speed
The new iPhone 16e indeed brought the notch back
"Coming from an older iPhone, the USB-C and Dynamic Island feel like welcome upgrades that enhance everyday use. While the 60Hz display is a letdown, the overall experience is still a significant step up. Definitely a solid choice if you're upgrading from an iPhone 11 or older."
i’m sorta done with iphone their new phones keep getting worse and worse🙏🙏
Long time android user... I've been on my samsung s10plus for all this time... I'm going to try an iPhone 15 or 16.. thank you for this review.. and yes I'm still going to keep my s10plus😅
You gave me a lot of knowledge brother thank you
"and this one is, cheaper, better, has dynamic island and ships with ios 17"
so am I better of with 15?
​ @psnsimo yes 100% even with slightly worse battery
My note 20 ultra 5g battery just expanded. Had it for almost 5 years Im a hardcore android user and im buying this... it better not fail me
Screen recording
I just upgraded from an 8 plus to the 16 pro max
I don’t have the best eyes and yet 100% agree with your statement.  The 120h screams are amazing
"I know…🤦🏼‍♀️ Lack of DI, - what’s all that about ⁉️"
One of the best iPhones ever made.
Ya'll think I should save up for a refurbished iPhone 13pm or do a 3 year phone plan and get the 15?
whats the game at 7:05?
I upgrade my iPhone annually because of my job and I am rough on them so I am just glad to be getting a little more out of a phone that functions and works every time I need it
"00:03 - Apple's new iPhone 15 is not groundbreaking, but it excels in design and feel.
02:03 - The new iPhone has a less blue appearance and is very fingerprint resistant.
03:45 - Higher refresh rate is not a significant factor for most smartphone users
05:27 - Apple iPhone 15 lacks a higher refresh rate display for perceived performance.
07:13 - The iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Plus have impressive battery life and USB-C support
08:52 - iOS 17 update includes Voice Isolation mode, offline areas in Apple Maps, and battery charge limiter
10:36 - The newest iPhone 15 has a 24 megapixel default camera and a new auto-Portrait Mode detection feature
12:21 - Upgrade to iPhone 15 for better performance"
I am currently watching this on my iPhone 15 😅
Outstanding review thank you 🙏🏻
You’re just shitting on the phone the whole vid. I came here to feel good about this phone and its potential. Not just have you trash talk it the whole time KMT
just me or the battery not good on these ?
2:49 he just predicted the future randomly
2:50 He predicted the new iphone se bringning back the notch
2:49 bro predicted iphone 16e
"iPhone is a scam😂😂😂
IDK why people are still chasing every new released iPhones.
Smh..."
"Very rare for me to be impressed by an American commentator. 
👍👍"
"I got this phone as work phone, sure it works flawless so far,  though im not fan at all of apple."
i hope rear camera soon for smartphones is removable like modular for wireless camera❤🎉🎉
iPhone 16 vs 15 which one is value for money?
Just updated to the iPhone 15
From ur experience does it worth?
I said it in my head and saw this comment 😂
"The typical iphone buyer : oh cool, an apple logo....
Spends 1yr worth of savings"
I switched from a S24 to a Iphone 15. Yes the 60hz screen is worse but its not a dealbreaker. Something that was a dealbreaker though was the extremly bad battery on the S24. Cant understand how reviewers say the battery of the S24 is comparable to the IP15 when its clearly not. Samsung get your shit together.
I got one of these as a company phone and it blows my mind that my cheap $250 moto has a better OLED screen in comparison. This thing is an eye sore and ill never understand the point of these at this price. Its laggy too. I assume and hope the pro models are much much better.😂 No shade to iPhone fans.
They should make iPhones with the same kind of screen light they used to use. It’s blinding now days
Great review bro ❤
My 15 takes forever to charge and dies fast
"bruhh it hurts, when i switch from my 90hz android to my fathers 60hz iphone, i can see the difference and that hurts my eye"
I came from a IPhone 13 Pro Max to this. And it was horrible. Standard iPhones for someone under the age of 50 sucks. And I only use iPhones and have been since the 3GS.
"I am also one of those peoplw that cant tell the dofference between 120hz and 60hz. Hell, i am hard pressed to discern a difference betwen 60 and 30. Point is it has much more reasonable application in a conputer than a phone. A phone is for browsing internet and watching youtube videos."
should i buy 15 or 13???
I keep trying to find a video for seniors who want very basic “how to” info
"Marques is absolutely the most handsome tech reviewer <333 Also, he is extremely non biased and fair. My absolute favorite tech reviewer between him and Justine although we know she is definitely biased to Apple(I am too so that's fine by me) She does a really good job at being informative as well but Marques good God what a stud."
What is the weather app?
I just changed from an 8 to a 15 and there is a huge difference! Specially on how fast 15 is compared to my old one. But the best and most important to me are the cameras. It’s AMAZING!
Have an iPhone 10 right now and planning on updating to the 15. Thanks for this review!!!
Guys i have a samsung s24 do i change from that to an iphone 15.. i just prefer the ios and ui on the iphones
I can’t believe what apple came up with to bring the ipad pro in 2017 with 120hz display
0:55 (ULTIMATE)
"Ive went from a iPhone 11 to a pixel 7 to now the iPhone 15 . just to add , the difference of herz doesn’t matter. Herz is something you get used to in no time and doesn’t add anything but a wow factor for scrolling, videos on YouTube and pretty much all streaming services are always max 60fps (hz). So people endlessly complaining that the standard iPhone don’t have 120hz is bad when the picture quality is insane and the integration of the ecosystem. Just to add all google services work as well on iOS as on the pixel, so I found all my time wasted on a pixel when the iPhone has much more to add in combination with a laptop good for studying etc."
 @dolbowen150 but why tho?
 @brianpeppers8236 because a 15 is newer than a 13 and usb c is better than a lightning charger. I use a 500gb ssd drive with my 128gb iPhone 15
Arent missing much with 13. Just a design change (dynamic island)
It's called '(Not Boring) Weather'.
Mine is being delivered as I type
1:01 😂😂😂😂😂😂”how does apple say it”?
Why does it feel like iphone 15 is so slow? I just got mine and it feels like I wanna refund for it. Its giving me bad vibes
You earned a Sub
Just got the iPhone 15 upgrading from an Samsung A53 4G the first thing I noticed is that it doesn’t take 20 seconds to type 1 letter
"I had an iPhone 13 regular , I finna have iPhone 15 pink color 🔥"
"I’ve upgraded from iPhone 11 to 15 and as a standard user, honestly as much as ridiculous this might sound but the biggest change for me day-to-day is just USB-C."
"I upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 15 and I must say, the difference is big. Especially the build quality, display, Dynamic Island, 48 MP resolution and 6 GB RAM! Really, good! ❤️"
"upgraded to this phone from the 11 pro max. me not using the telephoto lens made me realize I am ""most people""."
"Hi there!
What cable is that at 7:30, the red one with a white connector?
Thanks!
edit: it's a Oneplus cable."
Does it go 95mph?
My recommendation-Dont go for an iphone lol
"My iPhone XR just decided to suicide by itself and won’t turn on after like 6 years, it’s been a great phone but it’s time to move on I guess. I think I’ll get the iPhone 15 it seems to be awesome."
"Coming from S23 FE to iP 15, i didn’t missed the 120hz screen on S23 fe somehow, barely noticeable"
"I have an iPhone 13, my first iPhone ever for being an Android user all my life, and the 14 doesn’t have enough difference for me to get it and the 15 isn’t different except for USB-C. I’m really waiting for the iPhone SE 4."
Wish I can have one of those I got iPhone 6s:(
"i switch from iphone 8 to iphone 15: its a solid phone, but guess i will switch to a55 samsung galaxy, i find it odd to even leave my iphone for scared of being stolen,,,no such is worth that ...if you have insured your phone,...so it was a good solid phone..worth it..."
"im here in 2024 and i just want the
 iphone 15 in black, the phone looks great the features are cool its pretty worth it"
How do you protect yourself from radiation please let me know thank you ?
Isiphone15. 5 g can I ut it up to 4 g
I loved this video

NO ONE will be listening to this recommendation
@Whodey3  If I want I can get Iphone 16 right now but I won't because iphone is a big stupidity lol
All new. !!!    Ok.  😂😂
"I just upgraded from a iPhone 8+ to a 15 standard. I’m going to miss my home button, but I look forward to finally joining the future."
I'm thinking of upgrading from XS max to 15 is it worth it?
This is my first phone I ever got when it came out i got it as a birthday gift when I turned 13 still have it
"Is it a mistake to switch from a Galaxy S22 Ultra to this phone?
Have been interested in switching to iPhone for a while now. Any ideas?"
Laura khao…means its awesome
"Im upgrading from iPhone 11 to iPhone 15pro, cant wait to feel the difference, especially since my cameras never worked on my iPhone 11😂 I feel like im going to be blown away 😅 also o noticed that alot of people arw upgrading from iphone 11 glad i was doing something right 🤣"
I haven't watched ur video bcz of Motorola's ad.
My late son Ashish Panda introduced me to you.He was a fan of yours.Thanks for your precise analysis
Mine is model black don't have the model printed inside the usb-c charger port
"i watched this video and selected the Apple iPhone 15 max pro this week in anticipation of Apple ai this week.  
for what it is worth i love it including the size.  it just feels good in my hands.  keep your mind out of the gutter."
Watching on an ip 15 I just bought
If you want AI you gotta get the pro
How did he casually predict the IPhone SE 😂
"I would call these colors Bubblegum, Lemonade, Peppermint, Glacier, and Midnight."
"When he said ""box of crayons"" I was dead 🤣😂"
Laury Coves
"I might have to buy a new iPhone since my13 doesn’t receive any notifications!! that’s how Apple make money by crashing your own devices down into buying a new one, thanks Apple 😊"
Definitely. I upgraded from XS to the standard 15 a year ago and it's made a great difference
Really sorry for your loss. God bless.
"4:00
My brother has an older iphone and tried my phone which is 120 hz samsung 20fe

He immediatly said how smooth it is and it feels that way. It just feels like its skipping a beat. Idk if apple does the 60 hz better but it does make a difference..."
which is this the opening song
Thank you so much Brother
I had a iPhone XR for about 6 maybe seven years and just upgraded to an iPhone 15 pro max but I feel as though that the battery just diminishes to quickly in my opinion
I am thinking of buing this one
Does anyone know what app he has for the weather?
"I upgraded from the 6S to the iPhone 15 and it is a HUGE difference, lol I'm just not a fan of upgrading yearly, and changed it now because the 6S was fighting for his life. I won't get another upgrade for years to come..."
Thank you!
woot is selling these right now. I just bought 1 in pink
 @TheR999  im from europe (poland idk if its availabke )and im planing on buying from apple straight
It’s called (not boring) weather app
"I have an 8 Plus, owned it for four years and about to upgrade to a 15. I normally upgrade once every 2 years and while I wasn’t planning on owning my current phone as long as I have it made me think about how I could own my next phone for four years as well and still probably function as good as this phone was at its peak."

7:00 what game is that ?
I got a IPhone 15 recently and only payed tax
Here after iphone X6 i mean 16 launch 😂
Too much yap man just show the damn phone and say what’s different from the last one bruh damn
"Watching this video after I bought the iPhone 15, I’ve newly joined the apple family & excited to see what does it have in store!"

"I'm upgrading from iPhone 6s, do you think that it's worth the upgrade or shall I stick with my 6s for a few more years?"
If i get 100 likes I will challenge myself to buy iPhone 15
whats the name of that weather app?
"And now the base model is irralivent with the lack of support from A.I, undoubtably the shortest relivency i’ve seen from any phone"
Your the man! Top reviewer!
This guy makes the most overrated reviews on YouTube. Every time i watch it’s just so useless and dull

Waiting patiently for the iPhone 16 review drop vid @mkbhd
watching this again to make my 15 feel new😊
@ahmadabuz liked his own comment!
Is there finally an sd card slot ? Cause if not I’m definitely not buying this. Esp for 1500$. They’re smoking. It costs them 10$ each phone to make in China
16 came out already just to let you know
I know bruh
same its almost 1 year old
Bring back Touch ID
Ok I just watched the 12 review ngl pretty much the same
welcome to the cult!
excuse me 60hz? DISPLAY? I LITERALLY HAVE AN ANDROID WHO HAVE 90HZ AND GUESS WHAT I CAN ADJUST IT HIGHER
If Apple make iPhone 15 120hz people will ditch the pro 😳
"Apple and people should not normalize 60hz screen screen. Just because people don't care about 60hz and the difference doesn't mean anything to them, doesn't mean they don't need 120hz."
Watching this on my S24
I like the pro phones but they are just so large.

"I just upgraded from the iPhone 13 to the iPhone 15. 

I am happy because it’s a dual sim.

I am also happy with the type C..

It has a satin back. Finger print resistant.. I so love.

And it’s black. 

Love it love it.."
I’ve got my 15 but once I finish paying it off bc I’m an idiot and went with a plan I’m gonna switch to Samsung
"This helped me decide on the base 15. Got a great deal on it via my work.

Almost went back to Android and tried the Google Pixel 9 or checked out what Samsung was up to these days but I like the smaller form and the smoother OS + build quality."
I sometimes get Captain Kirk or Fallout Responder Vendor vibes with the subtle smooth pauses MKBHD does.
All new? All new? The way Marques mimic 😅😂
I waited so long for this phone❤
I’ll buy it just because of how the front feature looks but other then that I don’t mind that it looks like the iPhone 14 and 13 lol 😂
"I recently upgraded from a 7 Plus to a 15 Plus. Man, are there so many differences!"
Most expensive phone in the world damn lucky I got mine from insurance only paid 250 for a brand new 15
I just upgraded yesterday from an iPhone 8 Plus to a 15. Loving it so much.
That’s because you are broke
I’ve had an 8 Plus the past four years and upgrading to a base 15. How’s it been getting used to your new phone?
"It’s a quantum leap from what I had before. I love the new Dynamic Island and the edge-to-edge display, not to mention the amazing camera setup and 5G speeds and current iOS! All of these features were not present on the 7 Plus! I originally thought I was going to get an iPhone 11, which had the notch, but this is more than what I was expecting!"
I’m on an 8 Plus currently with my plans lining up on an upgrade for a 15 although it’ll be after the 16 comes out. I bet there’s so much different things to get used to for it
" @lakerskid2013  the main thing i had to adjust to was the control scheme. Also, to shut the phone down, it's the side and one volume button because Siri is assigned to the side button alone. If you have a lot of Lightning accessories, get adaptors at first due to the USB-C port replacing it."
" @EwanCroft  Side and volume button, that sounds like an Android thing but I’ll keep that in mind. I have an iPod Touch (6th generation) and iPad (7th generation) so I’ll still keep those chargers for those devices. As far as USB-C chargers go I already make sure I keep plenty for my PS5 alone with charging my controllers."
" @lakerskid2013  you will get a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box too, but yeah. I also have a Dualsense so i'm in the same boat in terms of having USB-C cables already. Hope you enjoy the phone!"
" @EwanCroft  Thank you, I will be getting mine in the blue color with a black Otterbox case. I hope you enjoy your phone too"
 @lakerskid2013  I got the 128GB Black variant with a Spigen clear case. It's doing great so far.
"honestly when it comes to iphones,you literally buying the brand and the so called ""royalty"" of having it rather than the phone itself"
07:01 game name please?
"What device would you advice I upgrade to from the very old 6 series to, psst I’m on a 500 bucks budget though 🥲"
"I can't believe this phone came out almost 1 year ago, it feels like it just came out yesterday, Time really flies."
"idk whether to get this phone 14 pro or the 15 base, can i get some opinions?"
"Upgrading from a Huawei P20 to an iPhone 15, about time. Also first ever Apple device not including adapters"
"what weather app is that tho, looks slick"
I just upgraded from the phone 11 to the 15 and all i can say is it really isnt much different other than the camera and usb-c port. Im glad idnt have to pay the money and got the upgrade.
i’m about to make a decision should I get the iphone 15? or pixel 9?
"Oh my God, they change the colors"
Android phones do not have animations. 90/120 is the only way they feel good
Still rockin my google pixel 2
Upgraded from a iPhone first gen 3 gb to the iPhone 15 is a blessing 🙏
İ have the iphone 11 now for about 5years and my sister bought the 15 and i looked in her phone and i could barely see big changes between the 11 and the 15!! Everything is the same! İ don’t have the need to buy a newer iphone till there are big differences!! İ’m still so satisfied of my 11!!
yea its the same as the iphone 11 only that its more expensive i actually hate iphones the design is ugly they copied samsungs always on display and their ai so yea if you gave me a free iphone i would sale it and buy an s24 cause its better like come on my 500$ a55 has 10x zoom wile the 1200$ iphoe 15 only has 4x zoom
I went from a Nokia 3210 to a iPhone 15. I still know how to socialise.
4:40 is that the default weather app? How do i make it look like that?
Nah fuck 60hz my head is killing me every day I need 120 to cut out most of the digital vomit that happens when anything moves at all
"i would go with 14 pro, but if you rly want usb c, then go with 15, thats like the only reason."
What u like more iOS or android?
"I recently changed from 14 pro to 15 plus. Mainly because i want big screen and longer battery.
Honest to god, I don’t feel the slower 60hz display at all!! But the pro build material and appearance was missed dearly. Non-pro models just looks bland. It doesn’t feel cheap but doesn’t feel quality and top notch either. 
My gold 14 pro always gets compliments if i remove the case, but my new black 15 plus looks like every other phone out there."
"Oh yeah, 60 to 120 is a huge step. With your eyes when not accustomed, going to 60 to 120 is not that clear; But going from 120 to 60 ? Oh man, now that's obvious.

I remember when I disconnected my 120hz TV from my pc, when I plugged it back, it defaulted to 60hz, and instantly I was like ""oh wow, did I break something ? Why is it so laggy ?"" because when you are used to twice the speed, it really shows."
A phone is a phone doesn't matter witch model
That’s the main reason I switched from my iPhone 13 Pro Max to an iPhone 15 plus because of the new usb-c charger that apple introduced to iPhones
Very light as a feather
@mkbhd Which one is this weather widget at 3:10
Hey my brother  we have the same last name I will owe  look at u for new phone or tablet  that is good
whats that weather app
call recording should be a default feature in 2024
apple is weird as fuck nothing new but high prices
"In the last four almost five years I’ve jumped from an ip7, to a ip11, and now a ip15. So for me it’s a major upgrade. Like I can totally see the big difference."
7:00 what game is this?
Good one
Hey Marques should I get the iPhone 15 or the iPhone 13 Pro please help me I can’t decide
isheeps!
Yes I’m getting a 12
I got it for the camera its really good
I transitioned from 120Hz to 60Hz because of the performance
They gonna say All New Again but in reality it’ll be All Old Again
Could you please use Better Camera in your Video.... Cause sometimes its itchy in my Eyes.
To a normal user sure
" @Wyn3e  yeah, and wont need a premium phone, let alone a pro or something realy above 250$ :P ^^"
i think its called not boring weather
If ur buying a phone specifically for the cam and mainly the cam then it's a waste buy a actual camera
Yh I think it's just u or ur devices display cuz he's using one of the best cameras u can get 💀
how much are apple employees getting paid to say “all new” 😂
Worst phone I ever own.  I’m going back to Samsung . That’s what get for trying to fit in with the stupid Shallow crowd.
I love watching reviews of stuff I already have
"TY most helpful take away, best battery life on 15 plus and USBc"
What weather app is that?
What is that cool weather app he uses?
No this is just a classic... When you dont have a driver's license you apply in uber and tell them you will deliver by bike so you get routed as you would if you had one🤣🤣 the guy unfortunately didn't use all his brain cells 😂
i have upgrade iPhone 13 to 15 last month and i notice a big diference...especially i buy the iPhone for the dynamic island and USB C port and the 80% limit option charge.
"So basically, if i get the 15 plus and not the 14 promax ill only be missing out on the 120hz, always on display and extra zoom camera? Well i think i can live with that"
"So basically, if i get the 15 plus and not the 14 promax ill only be missing out on the 120hz, always on display and extra zoom camera? Well i think i can live with that"
you can judge me i bought this phone and i love it
"recently switched from SE 2020 to 15 
the battery life is like god damnnnnnnnnn lasts me 2-3 days with gaming (call of duty mobile, and Mad out 2 BCO mostly)
the display is just amazing 
dynamic pill is a great addition
and siri listens to hey siri everytime 😜 
I haven't really faced heating issues for the phone
the 60 hz on the phone doesn't really feel like 60?!??!!!!!!!!!!!!
it's just smooth and cameras 
the cameras are like night and day difference dude 
if u r switching from 11 or earlier it's the best upgrade u can have"
"I'm a low-key user who uses a phone for music, social media & phone calls mostly. I'd rather choose 60hz over a smoother display that'll eat up my battery. And, for me i guess the iPhone 15 would be a pretty good deal."
Who's watching in 2027? 😂
if nothing is new in i phone 15  why did u uploaded this video.... mistakenly  viewed
(Not Boring) Weather
Plus everything connected to ai in the future if that is something you care about
"120hz is variable. That means of not needed for example if you are watching YouTube with 30hz or there is no change happening to the display content it will adapt to an go down all the way to one hz. So it is actually more efficient. The 60hz will always be 60hz. 

But I can still understand your reasoning to go with the 15 after all"
Turning a normal photo to portrait and focus recomposition? My Xiaomi 4 did this 10 years back and did it pretty well.
i just upgraded from a 7 to a 15 yesterday everything feels new to me just hate the way it gets hot when charging .
This ain’t the same phone inna Mike Tyson time travel picture?
I come from an iPhone 8 to an iPhone 15 and obviously there is a lot of difference but the screen seems a little better to me
The phone that made me give up ob smartphones. Downgraded to an s8 with broken screen.
"Hi Marques. Upgrading from 12. With the jangly migraine inducing intro I thought oh no another witless ego trip type review, but no, intelligent, considered, knowledgeable and interesting. Good job."
I got a Samsung s10 now with 60hz aswell. Is the Iphone 15 worth the upgrade. Or is a s23 or s24 better?
"Ooh. I think i want this to be my first iPhone in the future. Question to iPhone user: Is there an issue with texting others who are android users? Because my family is android users for life, and before i got an iphone i wsnt to be sure i could text and contact them with no issue."
tbh the only way to feel a difference in a phone is to buy one every 5 years or so like my iPhone 10 Xs waited 5 years now to get a new phone buying a new phone every year will mostly make no difference to you maybe it’s just my opinion
Went from a second Gen SE to the pink fifteen earlier this year. And I LOVE IT!!
"Most iphone users have no clue about technical specifications because they just follow trends. For them it's all about saying ""I have an iPhone"" so I'm booshy and for them android phones are for poor people but they have no clue that there are android phones that are literally way more powerful than any iPhone. Android phones are based on open source software which you can do so much more if you are a technically savvy person. But iPhone users don't know anything about that. Also we are in 2024 why tf is apple still using 3000 milliamp batteries when android phones are packing 5000 to 6000 milliamp batteries which last 2 days with heavy usage. Smh"
All new was personal 😂
"Best battery life ever so also in the future, it will never be improved? Wow😂"
"What is the app that was being used called, it looks cool?"
Who is watching in 2024
I wanted to ask if its okay to use samsung 25 watt adapter to charge iphone 15 ? Will it cause any issue with iphones battery life or any other issues?
Which iPhone is good to buy for now
MARQUES UR ASPECT RATIO DOESNT FIT WITHIN IN THE IPHONE SCREEN ANYMORE THE DYNAMIC ISLAND BLEEDS INTO ITTTTY
Ill get this phone in about 4-5 years
"it's a 15 garbage even for 400$, any phone over 300$ outclasses it in every field"
what weather widget is that?
i went from the 14 to 15 and this is day 1 and i’m in love but that also could be bc my 14 broke and couldn’t connect to internet and bluetooth and was basically in the dark ages(unlimited data worked) but the dynamic island is so cool and it runs smoother tbh
My 11 is dying. Finally ordered a new one
I like iPhone 15 than iPhone 15 pro max
This guy looks like alphonso davies
Very amazing video and My brother has the 15 it looks very clean😊
"iPhone 15 has issues connecting to wifi, it’s very annoying……."
Got the 15 thinking 16 🤔
"funny thing is that I have a moto g, and it is literally slower than my sis's iphone 13 which is also 60 hz. ahhh how I would love to have the iphone 15"
Thank you... You saved mine 200$...
"Honestly, I like the pale color design because every other recent iPhone color design 11+ doesn’t look great when the color is so saturated. The light color design sort of matches the aluminum frame and glass. That’s just me though. It reminds me of very early Apple colors."
is 15 better than 14 pro?
"Went from a cheap android phone user to the iphone 15. what a great experience. I do not think i am going back to android based phones. When the time comes, i am going to swap out my windows based pc for a mac mini as well."
"Nerdy me, as an experiment, I'll occasionally go up to an iPhone user in the cafe is use, knowing the iPhone they are using, and I make gentle brief conversation and ask them, what iPhone is that? Most have no idea, they just say, no idea mate, it's just an iPhone that's fine for me."
"I’m a simple man, I see a new iPhone I buy the Pro version. Works every time."
literally
Good review!
I hate that it doesn’t have product red will not be purchasing
Yes basically but at the same time depends on what features are important to you
"thought about getting this phone, thanks for a good and honest review"
I think iPhone can't go for a 90hz refresh rate because of the battery capacity. 🥱
7:00 what is the name of this game please?
One thing I don’t like about the 15 is that it uses usb c I know that in Europe thay changed to just usb c and it might be I good phone but idk bc I got the 12 and with usb c it’s hard for me bc when I go to a friends house they have an 15 I would got but can thay just release a version in America with the old charger and that’s it. Thank you
I have a 13 Pro Max. The second the base iPhone gets 120hz. I’m getting that. I just can’t justify the price for the higher range models anymore
i might upgrade my iphone se 3 to Iphone 15
Upgraded from 11 pro to 15 just for the Dynamic Island and the usb-c. It’s worth it
What's the 120hz phone hes using as example?
Iphone 15 or S24? I Currently own a S22.
Imagine finding your phone from your Apple watch in your own house. We.. that pathetic
Went from a se to a 15 w
when will they remove that annoying notch 🤦🏻‍♀️
Should I upgrade if I have the 13?
Stop looking at the scripts
Thank you for the review.
Apple is just toxic 😂
Bro the iPhone 15 looks like a toy phone 📱from a gift bag 😂😂 people are absolutely crazy to buy it. The other models yes. Honestly you couldn't really convince anybody because you wasn't convinced yourself. It was written all over your face 😅😅 I hope they didn't pay you because they will ask back for their money
"Who use iPhone 15
👇"
"Keep ur phone bro, or jst replace ur battery. Im currently rocking a S21 and gonna replace my battery soon and jst use this phone into the ground. Theres basically zero reason for me to upgrade to the S24..."
i mean i did on saturday and i dont really think so like it does the same thing as the 13 and looks somewhat the same besides the charger port and colors but i also think theres like more features to the 15 so if your 13 is acting up or something i think it would be fine to get a 15
Insane price for nearly the same phone as 2 or 3 generations back. Slight improvements. Waste of money
"60Hz is fine. I'm a tech coinsure personally, and developer professionally, I also film (peep my channel to see), but could not justify the price tag of the 15 pro. I ended up getting the 15 plus. Better battery, and great everything else. I actually was going to get the 14 plus recently, but only opted for the 15 plus for USB-C so I could have one cable to rule them all. I absolutely do not care about 120Hz plus on a phone screen, if anything, I'd prefer otherwise to save battery life. Now, my gaming monitor is a different story."
"Anyone help,is 128gb enough storage?"
Problem with OLED display is you can't use UV sanitizers for phones.
same phone in new body
Just upgraded from my 12 Pro to the 15 the other day. No “wow” moment but the phone is a nice refresh and the faster processor and Dynamic Island is nifty
Cool how you got that Osmos HD game. Not available on android anymore
I'm probably gonna buy the Iphone 15 because I've used android for a long time so I wanna try something new. And it's good that they have usb c now so I can just use my 45w charger. Also what colour iphone 15 should I get? I'm a teenage boy by the way.
honestly after the review i will keep my a53...
I've upgraded from an iPhone XS Max to an iPhone 15 and it's HORRIFYINGLY good
Which weather app wedget you are using?
Going from an android to a iPhone 15 is what I could only describe as being dropped in a Vietnamese classroom and expected to learn and comprehend whats going on around me. Great phone I love it👍
"I’m watching this on a 6 SE, and I’m getting one tomorrow"
I might get an Iphone 15
What is that weather app
I compared a 7plus with 15 and they are both 60hz but interestingly the 15 felt more like a 40 hz while scrolling! I definitely noticed the difference
60hz is embarrassing
"Just ordered a pink 15 to replace my purple 12, and I’m watching this to squeeze all the dopamine out of the decision before it even gets here. This is a beautifully shot video Marques!"
Nokia had these camera features 12 years ago 😅
To be honest my poco 120 Hz is worse than my wife 60Hz iphone 11
"Depends on if you have or planning on loads of apps, pictures, and videos or not. I’ve had an iPhone 8 Plus for four years and chose 128 GB at the time of purchase, used up 77 GB so I still have 51 GB left. I don’t have many apps but I do have a wide variety of music which is right around 1,500 songs."
Same here 😂
Literally same
Did they tho
"To people having trouble about iphone, let me list down some things as a user of iphone 15:
1. Dynamic island might be a distraction, but you get used to it. just like your nose.
2. a16 bionic is a future proof chipset
3. ios is different but not problematic. most of the features that are shown to be missing in comparison are the ones, people wont be using in their daily live. they are spaecial use case features.
4. lack of back button is only a frustration when a button gets stuck behind the keyboard in an app ui, otherwise not.
5. you have to habituate your hand of longer and much more swiping movements than that on android. 
6. file system is decent, you wont be using it that much.
7. display is good.
8. speakers are amazing. nothing comes close except pixel.
9. ios has amaing reliability but newer updates of ios are very very buggy these days.
10. ecosystem is a fraud thing. not of much use if you dont buy icloud+ and sync your photos with it. universal copy is good.
11. gallery is not good. no segregation in main gallery. all photos become visible in recents.
12. heats a lot while charging. so much that you wont want to hold it in hand.
13. selfie is pretty unsatisfactory in iphone.
14. iphone 15 is very comfortable to hold. 12, 13 and 14 models feel sharp in hand.
15. iphone 15 battery not very long lasting. i dont play games, only insta youtube and other apps, still have to charge twice a day. i plug it above 25% and up to 80% most of the time."
I have iPhone se 2... Should I consider buying iPhone 15
Very useful review! Thanks !
"Marques Brownlee, I really liked this video! I subscribed too!"
give me one please 🥹
"Please refrain from purchasing an iPhone if you intend to reside outside of the US. I bought mine in the US, then relocated abroad for work. Following the latest update to version 17.5, my screen began flickering intermittently. Initially, I disregarded it, assuming it was minor. However, the situation worsened when the screen turned yellow. Despite diligently following all of Apple's support advice, none of the suggested solutions resolved the issue. Consequently, I had to bear nearly half the original cost of the iPhone 13 Pro Max to replace the screen. Can you believe it? I have little confidence that Apple will provide any meaningful support. So why invest such a substantial sum of money? I have resolved to never purchase another Apple product again. I even wish I had accidentally dropped the phone and shattered the screen; at least that would have been comprehensible, rather than the screen being destroyed simply because Apple released an upgrade. It's incredibly frustrating"
I think that Apple means the « Inside design »?
"If I’m on 120hz I can’t see it, but can feel it 4:00"
Funny enough i Have never used an Iphone because i use to say they we so expensive compared to everyone... and then samsung announced there 1800$ fold that i bought so i suppose i could try an iphone
Fuck yt why am i getting 20 sec ads
Who is here after i phone 16 is launched?
I think if people become more knowledgeable about the tec side of things possible iPhone will be forced to give you real value for your money. I find iPhone users don’t demand more from them. Smh.
I saw the 4:20 clock reference 😎
october 2 is my birthday
should i go from 12 mini to 15 not pro or plus?
"thanks, ill be getting my first iphone and it would be the iphone 15
im upgrading from a redmi 9 and i think that is a very huge upgrade considering my redmi 9 costs only 150 usd"
"Sir, wait for SE 4"
"I have a iPhone 12 mini, still really fast, but battery life sucks. Already changed battery once. Thinking of buying the 15?"
"Great, incredible review on iPhone 15!"
"So I have an IPhone 12 and It’s in bad Shape, Which Would be better? I’m a heavy User But I’m stuck Between IPhone 14 Pro or the IPhone 15 (Base)."
So Hot take refresh rate doesn't  matter. It all feels the same.
"This was a perfect review for me. Thank you Marques! You made it an oddly fun review also, really hooked me. SUBSCRIBED!"
"Just upgraded from iPhone 13 base model to iPhone 15 base model, not much difference noticed yet but have only had it a couple hours lol i really think it just feels more premium with the new back of them, no fingerprints etc. Takes super good photos, usb c a game changer, and dynamic island will probably be useful once i start messing with it."
"The camera specs of the iPhone 15 & 15 plus phones are the same, but in some comparison videos, the video quality (stabilization) seems to have a slight difference.  Is it so?  Can you explain a little?"
SE (2016) to 15 (2024) and thought it was worth it
Coming back to this review. The most people dont care or dont notice part. This is probably the difference in apple now against if steve jobs wouldve been head of apple for atleast longer then it did. 60hz sucks now for everything except typing and video.
I upgraded my iPhone SE to the iPhone 15 in blue and I love it
I'm sure the 60Hz refresh rate has to do with battery life
Just upgraded from iPhone 11 to 15 the phone is a delight to use.
Suggest mr OnePlus 12 or iPhone 15 for good camera and performance longterm
"Please someone, what weather app is he using 🙏"
"now here is the interesting part, apple service centre puts a scratch on my iphone display and refuses to accept it. wow Apple you get the best customer service award for this."
"Unfortunately the 12 is on the weaker side of battery life and my friend who just got her first iPhone is already dealing with those problems. I’m on an 8 Plus that’s four years old with 73% battery life and I’m planning to go for a 15, still will even after the 16 launches."
"id go with base 15, pretty much same price and internals with better battery and another yr of updates"
it dont at all had a s21 and i couldnt notice after 5 mins it just kills the battery now i got the 15 an feels no different then ts did on 120
you have obviously never felt high refresh rate then
 @benjizp4  My sister has a iPhone 15pro I genuinely don’t feel the difference (for context I have a 13mini)
thats gonna be me this summer! i currently have the se and will be purchasing the 15 in the summer
"You know the iOS you never notice na 60 hrts , I used it it very smooth ,important to me watching. Movvies n YouTube important to me the accurate color of the screen , that what I pay for , iPhone is the best  screen with its True Tone , and the camera superb , I don’t like android china phone , if you want that go , look all the Hollywood celebrities using iPhone iOS ,,don’t base on the stupid 130 hrts , it consume more batery to  drain faster ,,if you have money this is a solid phone , waistng of time echoing your review 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
who is watching this at 11 AM
who is watching this in 2030
who is watching this in 2024
i don't mind the baseline iPhone not having 60 Hz refresh rate.  A little problematic if it still costs $800 though.
Still on the 7 probably time for a upgrade idk probably wait for a 16
AUF MEINE SIMULIERTE FRAGE ?
MEINE FRAGE KÖNNTE NUR SIMULIERT SEIN
"Apart from the fact that the Apple's OS has always been shit in literally all of their devices, clearly including the rather yearly ""updated"" iphone, it's simply no surprise. The restrictive nature of apple is obvious in their OS and you simply can't do crap; compared to other devices from different brands. I had apple for years, and I decided to stop buying their scammy little woke shit products. Stop funding this load of scammers that try to create a standard when in reality they are controlling and restricting you to hell with devices that have hardware that is not worth it compared to other option in the market, and an OS that is the literal definition of ""shitty restrictiveness"". Free yourself from this crap."
"I have had my Samsung Galaxy A52s for 3 years now. This phone does support 120hz but early on I enabled the energy saving mode because I valued battery more over the 120hz that then got reduced to 60hz. Honestly I didn't even notice that I was using it like this for so long before I got into research about the iPhone 15 because I want to switch soon. I think, I couln't care less about the refresh rate."
"What you guys are missing is it may be 800€ phone and stuff, but dont forget Apple makes its own software and that is included in the price"
"iPhone 15 all the way. For a while now I have been buying old pro versions years after their release, and this has served me well.

For the first time I am going to buy a brand new iPhone 15 because of the USB C port, its shelf life and resale value. I currently have a Samsung S10+ but I also use a MacBook Air M1 which has a capped refresh rate of 60hz.

For most people, these so called pro features don't really matter and go unnoticed."
What weather app do you use?
lol yall buy anything new from apple even if it’s a new color same component 😂 60 hz is crazy for 800
Personally I feel that even if budget phones have 90 hertz they will feel just as smooth as 60 a lot of times and it’s not a good 90 htz screen like I don’t mind 60 htz because I have never owned a pro product with promotion but 90 htz is not that big of a difference especially in budget phones
I sleep at 8 PM how are you guys staying up to 11 AM ?!?!??!
$800 for iphone 15? Meaning.. i was scammed for 1.5k? Or what is happpening?
Apple didn't get to the richest tech company position without defrauding their customers and they are good at it
I wanted the nice shiny gold... Not mustard yellow ugh :(
Recently upgraded to 15. So surreal that I can charge my iPhone with my charger for my Nintendo Switch.
Great review. It helps me a lot. Thank you. 😎
I love your videos! Im planning on upgrading for the iPhone 7 thanks for the help!
"not sure if this will get much reception now, but i am using a motorola g62 phone, cheap, 120hz refresh rate but also SLOW ! phone is capped at 64gb at base and the thing is always having problems where it burns up and apps crash. will be saving up for the 15 now as my very first iphone, just conscious that the refresh rate is going to HALVE in the switch. should i be concerned ? i am not too sure how much i will notice."
Apple has the smoothest 60hz display so it doesn’t make a very noticeable difference between 120hz i mean yeah having a smoother  120hz display  is quite nice but 60hz on an iphone is more than good enough for average consumers
"I'm really contemplating about the changes apple is making with every successive iphone and the price hike that comes with it.
Honestly , i think Apple is good enough and kind of justified for the price but still i feel they could've done a little better with the changes as i feel that there's negligible upgrade in the previous 3 models of iphone except for few minor additions tbh."
this guy has huge hands. For most people the 6.1 inch iphone 15 is not goit to fit in one hand like he is showing here.
"you catch my attention. i wish i  could grab some iphone or any phone you dont use anymore. more power, from Philippines🇵🇭"
Due to the pink color I will be using the 15 plus more than the pro max
"""With the brightness of a box of crayons"" 😂😂"
I still find it funny talking about refresh rate your eyes can only see up to 49 grams ps meaning its all placebo
My 13 is starting to crap out so idk if I wanna go to the 15 or the new Samsung
"4:31 I can't believe you're playing 'Frank Ocean - Ivy' on your phone. That's the first song that comes up when I accidentally press play on my earpods. RELEASE AN ALBUM, FRANK!"
Maybe inflation? Your model? If not or other factors I haven’t considered then yes u def gotten scammed.
That'll be a huge jump
The only reason stoping  me from buying androids is that their pictures don't look good on social media. So if they optimized their apps for androids then what's stoping me from getting a phone with good camera and 120hz screen that i can cuztomize the way i want. And thats why people think iphones are better.
"The iPhone 15, the same s word we’ve been introducing since the 11"
any ongoing issues with overheating on the 15/15+?
Just writing in comments that I'm gay because no one reads it.
"Moved from a Samsung S21 Ultra (2021 release date) to a Iphone 15, yes I notice the lag between 120Hz to 60Hz,  but couldn't justify the extra $ for buying the 15 pro. Anyway guess samsung was years ahead with technology"
"I just got a iPhone 15 and I can’t tell you what’s worse. Between the C-TYPE port and the “All new” design, which one has more emotional damage? 😭"
need opinion whether i should get the iphone 15 or iphone 15 plus
"Perhaps it’s my eyes, but I’ve always felt the 120hz screen on my S21 ultra feels smother than my 15 pro. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Do you think you can get a phone for your children
"I would have gotten this phone, but for the price, I need 120hz."
"I've got a 13 rn and I'm not gonna upgrade for another year or two...mostly because though I'm a tech enthusiast....I don't use my phone for much....no social media.....no photo editing, it is just a communication device and a camera that takes good enough photos for me......maybe the iPhone 17 when it comes out, always the base model or the plus....pro is just too much pro for me"
"what's that application youre using 
whether app or what is that ??
that looks cool"
Brilliant Review. I have just upgraded from the SE 2020 to the 15. Amazing 😊
bec of this f stuff now samsung has over take apple
I can't see the difference with 60hz and 120hz on my Zenfone 10🤷‍♂️
I just upgraded from 10XR to IPhone 15
Still on my iPhone 8.
Someone should like and subscribe hehehe oooooh ahhh
That’s amazing! I have the 2020 SE and I’m still debating what I should do. The phones now days are a bit pricey for me but also this SE is getting on my nerves each day! How do you like your new phone?
 @jaiharris19 wait for the se 4 next year
Love that 4: 20 on the clock bro💯💯
I went from the iphone xs max to the 15
Should I get the iPhone 13 pro or iPhone 14
"I am in the camp that simply doent care, but i also know completely what im missing."
"About the high refresh rates on cheap phones, there's also the OnePlus Nord N100 with 90Hz that is often found for even cheaper than $170. The screen looks halfway decent but the hardware inside can barely ever take advantage of it."
I wanted to buy 15 but because of the refresh rate i don’t buy frustrated
didnt even show the diff colors smh
What’s that weather app?
"I only use the iPhone for browsing the web, watching Youtube videos and messages. Don't need 120hz really."
"The point is most of us normal users buy phones to keep them for  3 4 years, it will feel so outdated slow and laggy to use 60hz in 2030"
"3:40 honest to god, i have fiddled around with my old phone which has 120hz and i can't say that i've really used it all that much. It's a cool gimmik yeah but emulators still ran at locked 60fps, youtube videos are locked 60fps, basically every type of video sent or recorded on my phone are locked 60fps so i never really got a use out of it except are very few handful of game apps that allowed 120hz but let's be real the apps that allowed that were just not able to run on this thing with more than 60hz"
"I owned both pro max and normal 15 no need to watch review, 60 hrtz is same as 120 hrtz no difference. 15 looks nice easy catch"
"Bro, I have an Iphone 8 💀"
Here we go again with Marques. I was here when I was looking to get the ip12.
"I got my iPhone 15 in yellow I call it gold two weeks ago ,I had a 14 plus traded it in wanted a smaller iPhone always had the plus iPhones time for a change 😊💛"
"Apple....hmmmm how can we take more money from gullible people....
Gullible people.......please take my money."
wich game marques is playing ?
"Im still using the iPhone 8+, the last iphone with a physical home button. I have the iPhone 11 as a work phone and the swipe mechanics are annoying."
"iPhone 10s : + full display
iPhone 11s : + camera square
iPhone 12s : + sharp edges
iPhone 13s : + smaller notch
iPhone 14s : + dinamic island (pro only)
iPhone 15s : + USB C
iPhone 16s : + guess?"
i went from iphone 7 to iphone 15. Awesome i love the new iphone 15. the camera is amazing.
Agreed. 120 hz is so overrated.
Me too. Such a good phone except for the battery.
12? Isn't it too old?
" @DonizeteSA-x8f  yep, that’s why i got my 15 pro max just today :>"
Apple is the king of phones ❤
"Ok so like LCD to OLED ... is a huge improvement, or so then a hertz jump. Not saying hertz isnt important but black blacks and vibrate colors is more important to me lol"
First 30 seconds of him saying “nothing is new” is all I needed to know if it was worth the upgrade or not
Yay now all of my friends can't use my cable lol sweet
Bought it yesterday ❤
Upgrading from a Xs. Worth it.
Why don’t you giveaway one of these to your supporters like me 😂❤❤
"i'll be going with 16 from iphone 12 which got battery replaced after 2 years, guess 4 years will be a good jump"
"My 15 pro is slow as a snail, I wish I had my 11 back"
"Hi, I regularly check the battery usage history
 iphone, today Monday, April 1st I noticed that the date of
 yesterday, March 31, Sunday a. disappeared from the chart, missing
 all last 10 days appear but sunday skipped
 eri shows me but after 00:00 it disappeared passing from
 Saturday directly to Monday the history... .what can it be?
 Thank you"
"People defending Apple that 120hz is not needed and apple has upgraded processor
Well A15 is fast enough for 99% users...A16 doesn't make any difference to Casual consumer but 60 hz does"
"after 09 years use of 6 (16GB), i upgraded to 15. Overall happy, unhappy with the colour codes in 15 series…"
I got the iPhone 15 in December and it’s been amazing! Dynamic Island is great battery life is fantastic and usb-c is good to have. And honestly it’s smoother than my old phone and that was 90 hz
I have been trying to get my lady to upgrade. Your videos are helping me do some research! 🤓
Just the review i needed. Thanks man!
"Not paying for pro. Not overpaying for nerfed base model. Wanted an iphone, dont now."
Thank you! I always come to your channel to help me decide whether or not I should finally upgrade.
yess iPhone ❤
Apple is the overrated trash phone I'm switching
"A gay phone? Never heard of. Oh, you meant you."
To be clear was going to buy. Maybe 16 base model wont be lame
5:21 plz make a video on is there any cost difference between 60 hz and 120 Hz display
"I have a samsung s10+ that I've been using for the past 5 years, great phone but it has started to die. I'm thinking about getting an iPhone 15, good video dude"
Coming from a free government phone (Vortex) My iPhone 15 is simply amazing. The camera is just insane! I wish you were able to pause while recording video instead of just stopping. Other than that I’m very happy with my purchase.
Who tf even cares at this point about the texture or colour of the glass back that'll be hidden the instant you case it up. Phone manufacturers are so darn out of touch with consumers I swear. Apple's stock price decline is 100% deserved.
I hope Apple Watches this lol
Moving from 11 to 15 !!! ❤
Samsung S24 ad decides to play while watching this review is a banger🔥🤣
I have the “blue” 15 and Apple should be arrested for calling this blue. It’s white. It’s white.
Yeah...it's the same
my comment or iphone 15 which is more usless ?
i randomly get to upgrade from iPhone X to a 15 tomorrow and while I am a little bummed about no 120hz I am just happy to be on usb-c
"That’s a white iPhone 15, right? not blue"
I'm also a baseline iPhone user. As you said I don't care much about screen Hz or other things.
Why the 80% charging limiter doesn't exist in my 14 Pro Max 😭
It looks like the iPhone 5s older brother
I have a Samsung I just want to know if I change Over to iPhone can I transfer my saved passwords?
"""720p with a brightness of a box of crayons 🖍️""
😂😂😂"
So basically you’re saying that who buys this phone is an idiot ?
"Watching this on a Motorola g stylus 5G 2023. I love your face colored with a ""horrible screen"" and with a ""box of crayons"" for the smartest budget. Still wondering if iPhone is worth the extra 800-1000 dollars for a more artistic palette. An artist talking here. 😂 Looks like people just buy these year after year because they want to belong to the cult and the wow improvements (note the sarcasm) Instead of improving their bank accounts (note the irony) ahh I shall see you in line at the apple store my sheep. Walk slowly."
Now this is an honest review....love you brother
Facts
"I just bought a week ago and found out that my iPhone 15 is getting hot while using my camera 
Did someone experiencing thesame?"
"I cant find online if i can watch 1080p videos on youtube on an iphone 15, i tried on the iphone 14 and it wouldn't let me, can someone tell me if the iphone 15 has a 1080p resolution to be able to watch youtube videos in high definition? 🙏🏻"
about to upgrade from iphone se 2020 to this
So Mr Marques Brownlee i would like to ask you as a professional of telephony should i buy an Iphone 15 yes or not especially i never used in my life an Iphone and using an android S22 Ultra and prefer not to spend more money on ios phones until i test the Iphone 15...
me watching it while i know i dont have the money for it
"Upgrading my iPhone 8+ to the 15+, last time I went from an iphone4s to the 6+ 😂"
"It needs a finger print scanner, punch hole, 120Hz, a better PWM dimming. Apple has not understood that the competition is with other brands, not with themselves. It is something similar to Samsung with the determination to use Exynos and thick screen bezels in its A series and S23 FE. Really honest review, btw, Apple left the chat."
"marques, your videos are great but one of the features u mentioned was already in the iphone 14 before the 15 relased and i have seen u have mentioned in other iphone videos where u tell this feature is new. i understand u review a lot of phones u may miss out on some of the features keep making videos."
"As an Android user, I am purchasing new phone.

Which one should I buy, iPhone 15 or S24?"
"My 14 within month touch mot working is this because its now made in india,,,i lost the hope from ip ,that was my first apple switch experience,,,im gonna sell this crap and ill go for s24 or a pixel"
I miss the purple color that my 11 had. I wish they would bring it back
"On the iPhone 12, so it's either the 15 or s24 for my needs and budget. 😅"
I love my midnight 15. The battery life is amazing and finally usb c!
"99% of people put cases on phones so nobody cares about edges , glass back colours"
So buy the 13 gotcha 😂😂
wow... i phone changed to usb c.....
Updated from 7 plus to 15 sooo happy
This why I upgrade every 4 years Apple has zero creativity when it comes to phones.
Went from 11 to 15 and my iPhone 11 lasted me abt 5 and half years 💯
"Been using android for years and wanted to try on iOS.  I wanted to buy an iPhone 13 but all the stores that I am checking into has no ip13 (sad-sold out/out of stock) so decided to get Iphone15—my first ever iPhone!!! I hope I won’t regret it. Loving it so far, it’s only hours years old in my hand. 😅😅😅"
ANDROID ON TOP
Bro why every iPhone looks all the same 😢 VIVA ANDROID 🤖
"ngl, I'm a big tech nerd, always on the latest video game consoles, pc upgrades, vr, mechanical keyboards, music gear, tvs, monitors, etc. But as for my phone that's really where it ends for me. I just want a nice phone that takes decent pics when I feel the need and functions as any other phone with nice enough battery life."
You’re so talkative and not helpful
800 for a phone they better have a 120hz
your hands are so big that they make the phone look small (in your hands!)
"I upgraded from a iPhone 7 that I had for many years, so I see this as a W 😂"
The comments here are more worth than the video
"I dont care about oles, 120hz, notch, prozessor, camera, usb c what ever. I just want a beautiful phone. And thats iphone"
"Good video. 

Watching this on my new iPhone 15 black."
"Coming from an 11 I have some thoughts. USBC is great, especially because my iPad Air, Beats earbuds, Mac, and Switch all use it. The screen’s a massive upgrade too. I have twice the storage on here. The dynamic island is cool too. At first I thought it was just a little gimmick, but it’s genuinely useful to be able to pause media, skip songs, stop timers, etc. without having to leave whatever app I have open. I could list more of these little things, but ultimately they all add up if you’re coming from an older iPhone."
What game was that at 7;00??
I liked my own comment
from ip8 to ip15promax is it a good upgrade? haha
best way to listen to music on wired earbuds for iphone 15??? cant find any good wired earbuds and the lightning-usb-c adapters are too chunky
I wanted a white iPhone 15 but they only have the white color on the iPhone 15 Pro and I can't afford the 15 Pro. So I was thinking of just going for the blue since this shade of blue is so pale it looks close to white.
Still on my iPhone 8.
Then don’t buy the iPhone
 @moraxter96  facts
I am thinking about to buy iphone  15 or s24 but iphone 15 has 60hz refresh rate and s24 has trash exynos chip 😂 so at the end i will probably get s23
Im getting the 15 - I have an 8 right now I’m pretty excittteedddd
"Regarding Apple not giving 90 or 120 Hz refresh rate, Apple has never cared for its customers and what users want. It has always been an adamant company who is like, don’t demand. Comply and use what we only offer"
lmaoo your so hung up on the framerate relax lol i couldent care less about the frames i use to have a s20 ultra with 4k 120 hz i have a s22 base model and kinda like it more just cuz the shape but i dont notice performance diffrences other than the screen being beter in the s20 ultra but i dident care cuz when do i really watch 4 k videos and the 120 frames just doesent mater to me witch is weird cuz ive been gaming on pc for 6 years or soo and if i see anything below 100 fps it looks terrible so i dont know why it doesent seem to bug me on the phone screen
"such great struggle to review this phone nevertheless, well done, as usual"
I literally compared this phone to my iPhone 12 and could not tell the difference and it feels dated cos it doesn’t have a 120 hertz screen
Upgrading to this soon
I’m still holding on to my 13 pro until the next iPhone. Will see how that turns out.
"Hello, i have a Iphone 12 mini, thinking in upgrading, the main reason is the short battery.
Not sure what iphone to buy, can you give me your advice?
Thanks"
"@5:45 this is so true and sad at the same time. Apple, please don't artifically make iPhone Base-model worse only to let Pro Model look better"
One plus 7 pro have a better screen then this new iphone. Colors on this iphone looks like crap in comparison with op7pro.
7:17 anybody noticed someone is walking outside in his yard?
I think it's a good idea to stop talking about body design of all smart phones and more features and specs/performance. How much more can the body of any smart phone really change.  Will it come to a point when smartphone reviews become irrelevant?  Just a thought.  Great video!
Please tell me the name of the app with the weather 🙏
"if I upgrade from ip7 to ip15, will it be worth it or should I just go for 13/14?"
just upgraded this made me feel better about my purchase
The only thing that pisses me off abt the iPhone 15 series is that pro max doesn’t have the same colour range of the iPhone ??? Like I want a pink pro max 😭😭
"I’m actually here because I thought something was wrong with my new phone because I upgraded from the 13 Pro Max, so going from 120 hz to 60 is definitely a noticeable difference and it’s the only thing about the iPhone 15 I don’t like. Love the color, love the size, looooove how much lighter it is!"
"teacher: I don't get paid enough!
also their phone:"
I just got my 15 yesterday and upgraded from an 8 plus😂 It’s awesome you’ll love it
I got an iPhone 15 this year and I love it
Design is still very important.
"Yes, the iPhone 14 also hat matt Glass."
Where tf is the SIM card thing someone please tell me I’m lost with a new iPhone 15
Apple: this iphone is all NEW and the best iphone we've ever made
3:15 what is that weather widget that he is using?
Call calling  me  iphone  15 😊😊❤❤❤
"I'm sticking to my 12 pro max, forth year now. That phone is too good still."
"My lightning chord connection is failing, the female receiver is just not allowing a good fit🤣🤣"
"Finally watching this on my own iPhone 15, upgraded from a used iPhone SE 2020"
what is name of the game being played at @7:06
Even the pro iphones turn off after couple of hours without using it.
I had the iPhone 11 for 4 years. Just got the 15 plus in black. It’s a good improvement. Not game changing dose everything my 11 did. But. It’s nice I guess lol. The island is cool
"I’ve bought all my iPhones outright so I just eat that upfront cost. I wanna own my phone it’s an important thing. 

Right now, the 14+ is what I’d buy. I’m broke.. but if I had the money for a new phone I’d rather have it than the 15/+. It has the satellite 📡 feature and best battery.. the slightly bigger screen is just a plus. I do basic pics and videos.. my iPhone 11 is fine for that already. 

I want that 14+ big time though. The 15 is pretty cool though, type-c would be nice."
Literally!
😂 bro wanted to confirm that was ALL NEW😂😂😂 RESPECT BRO
Why is this guy always complaining about something
"this guy is biased always hating on iPhone, Like how can you trust an android user to support iPhone 💀"
"Still using an xr at 81percent battery health,going to replace battery instead of upgrading 😁"
What is that weather app that’s so stylish ✨
A man entered into the studio
He said “ GET THE BORING NEW IPHONE” dang he got steel balls 🫶🏽🫶🏽. I know Apple sheep 🐑 are going nuts 😂😂😂
Flossy Carter says you look like a peasant if you have the iPhone with the 2 cameras on the back 😅 he says you gotta have 3 on the back Lol.
They never said that
The lighting has been a nightmare for me either works only one way or completely toasted after a month or so been thru like 10 of them in 3 years
"Found it 
(Not Boring) Weather"
"An OLED display is far superior to an LCD panel, i don't know how anybody can't tell the difference between the two. Same thing when it comes to 60Hz compared to 120Hz. 120Hz is way way smoother."
Hello Marques I know this totally out of subject but I got the iPhone 15 and I was wondering would you recommend charging my iPhone overnight using MagSafe the apple official one
"I’ve just ordered the basic iPhone 15, I’m upgrading from an iPhone 6 which is nearly 10 years old now!!!! Will this new 15 lady that long?😅"
"Apple lies (All new Lol
)"
Got no money to buy on this but still watching it rn getting jealous
If I have a 12 is it really worth it to get a 15 over a 14?
I would love seeing a video taking a look at all iphones ever released and kind of look at the design evolution? I'm curious to see what that would look like
3:58 it’s actually a major difference for me
My recommendation for u plz get a better mic to make the voice soft
"Lol , My 185 dollars Android smartphone phone have 120hz display .And USB C , We are using last 8 years 😂😂"
"I upgraded to the 15 pro from the XR and I notice a pretty big difference. But... I probably should have bought the base model, there is barley $200 worth of upgrades. The base model should already have usb 3.0 and 120hz"
Got a free upgrade with Verizon from my 11 to this. Definitely notice the difference
"screw the 120 hz in the pro and pro max😂
I saved around 300$ and bought myself an iphone 15 
reaaaally smooth❤"
What is that weather app at 2:55? The yellow widget.
1:05 Apple inventing it's own 'All new English language'
I’ll stick with my 128 iPhone 13
"I had the ip 7 plus for years and just upgraded to the regular ip 13, massive leap if you ask me"
nope buddy keep the 12 until it dies.... i am not kidding.... it's just your mind trying to justify but the 12 is already a great phone.
"If you need to buy now, buy 15. Its way better than 14, but i would wait at least another year"
Sorry even if you welcome me a million times i wouldn't join this club at all 🗿
I was curious about whats under the power button. Is that for a grip?
I still like my new Motorola razr plus 2023 better and my Samsung galaxy z4 flip and my Samsung galaxy z3 flip fast charging put my Motorola razr plus is the best
my eyes stops around 40fps 😂 first time i heard about 144hz gaming monitors i was laughing my ass off. but people really stubbornly claim that they can feel the difference between 120hz and 144hz
4:27 Thats actually very noticable in the dark espicially
"We all have to understand the fact that it is extremely challenging for any company to build new designs every new year : I mean what you are thinking? An iPhone with 5 Cameras, or with 120 Watt fast charging? It is not possible for sure."
…and it is relatively lightweight and fits nicely into the average trouser pocket…
"Thanks for a great review. For me, personally, I went for the iPhone 15 to get the small form factor. I got really tired of the heavy iPhone 13 Pro Max, so now I have an iPhone that works, is small in my hand and pocket, and can still do well with my everyday tasks."
"Bruh I was stuck between buying either iPhone 14 with 256GB, iPhone 14 Plus with 128GB and this iPhone with 128 GB cause all these three were priced with same amount. I bought this iPhone. What’s your opinion on my decision?"
My first ever iPhone. Time to explore the iOS cosmos.
"Great review, new iPhone 15 for me."
I received an iPhone 15 for work i hate it. My job mandates iphones. Imo its over priced garbage like everything apple makes
What weather app was displayed looks super cool
I only wish I had the option for those great translucent colors on my iPhone 15 Pro Max instead of the boring Black Titanium. It kinda reminds me of the old iMac from the 90s!
Ill be able to afford the iphone 20 when it drops. Today tho im broke
"iPhone xa to iPhone 15 is very OK for me. 

Battery is actually perfect for me."
The back is made of glass ????
Im thinking about upgrading to iphone 15 from iphone 12 is it a good choise?
"I’m watching this on my iPhone 6. Fits in my hand, plenty of storage and paid off for 10 years. Stop paying Apple again and again for the same thing."
Black
 @rahuldiddy  meaning if there is no 5g band then my phone version don't able to do 5g?
"once you use then for sometime, the differerence is 100% noticable"
I have an SE 2nd gen and about to pull the plug on this!
"Currently using an 11, have a 15 coming in. Wonder how different is will feel besides the charging ports, because that is going to need getting used to."
What will I notice the biggest difference from a 12 to a 15 . Thank you
Apple is a mess
"What widget was that, it looks like a weather widget. It looks awesome, please let me know what app that is. Some one. Please."
cmon the green looks stunning !!!
What was that game 😅
Great review..
Apple needs to ditch the notch for good.
"i upgraded from the XR (i know, its old) to an iphone 15 and it feels so much better and i think that’s how someone should upgrade"
I’m grtting tired of iPhone.  I feel as it’s the same thing over and over
"Dynamic island is new,24 48 mp is new , display nits has been upstreamed, type c , back panel , front cam autofocus 6 gb ram now etc etc Why such a youtuber started his video with nothing is new.
Disgusting"
I really loved the reaction on design 😂
"i was waiting for the iphone 15,iphone 15 plus,iphone 15 pro,iphone 15 pro max fine that its in phone shops now"
I got this today for my birthday. I love my mom ❤
"I’m gonna be upgrading from an iPhone 6+ at some point this year, so it’s definitely gonna be a big leap for me! I was already pretty set on the 15 just because of the USB-C port (my iPad pro and most of my other tech has it too, so it’ll end my cable-management suffering) and your reviews definitely help me feel better about breaking the bank on it!!"
Apple did the portrait effect after edits just like Samsung
As someone who went from iPhone 6 to 14 Pro. I will be keeping this for another 10 years 😂
"All new (the same) design for the last 10 years, ha-ha."
Apple phone is like a dinosaur it doesn’t matter what year you’re in😂
"FaceID was the biggest change to an iPhone and phones since we've been able to use our finger as a stylist. Haven't really been excited for anything since, I still have my iPhoneXR."
So sad that they removed Chinese handwriting feature in the keyboard.
Does anyone know what game he’s playing at 6:59?
As someone who has been a reluctant iPhone user since the iPhone 11 replaced my pixel 3. I have to say the 15 is the first iPhone that doesn’t feel like a compromise. I went iPhone because for whatever reason every android phone I had broke sooner or had abysmal battery life than it should have. The iPhone 11 solved my battery issues but the LCD screen was a letdown. The iPhone 13 had a nice screen but the phone was much less comfortable in the hand than the 11 and USB-C has become so ubiquitous that looking for a Lightning cable was becoming even more annoying. My Windows laptop charges via USB C. My headphones. My bike light. My DJI drone. My mouse. My keyboard. My PS5 controller. My TV remote. My iPad Pro. Literally everything. When the iPhone 15 came out I bought it specifically to get rid of lightning cables and was pleased by the hand feel and camera upgrades. This is legitimately the first iPhone that doesn’t have me looking at finding some Android phone that can take me away from Apple. I’d say that is a fairly substantial upgrade in subjective usability even if it is objectively only slightly better.
"For me, i upgraded it from 8+ to 15. So id say its definitely worth it 🎉"
"We just upgraded the wife from an 11 pro to a 15 pro because the old one was running hot. She said there’s not much of a difference she can tell, but this one still runs a little hot. 😮 I’ll keep running my 11 max until it give out. Personally I think their all new design looks like a way bigger version of the iPhone 4. For myself, unless I can score a smoking deal on an iPad mini and new phone, I may switch back over to Samsung and try out the fold 5 if the reviews are good."
I commented my own comment using iphone 15
What game is that at 7:00
"s24 ultra is a beast, proud of my purchase"
if only my parents afforded to get me an iphone😔
I love the Samsung ultra ad in the beginning before the video started
iPhone 15 = iPhone 14s ? 🤔
"I really don't understand what kind of a customer base does iphone have? They don't seem to understand the most basic, in-your-face things like 90hz display, OLED display that genuinely highly increase the user experience and  they have the capability to buy such expensive devices (which hints they are from modern, well-educated backgrounds) and yet somehow have such a rudimentary, poor taste in things. It truly baffles me! Only the most older generation person would not be able to differentiate between them."
You can say a 100 /1000 times that it doesn't but it will still matter. 120 hertz is important.
"They should make the iPhone regular series 120hz, but FIXED 120hz. Leave the adaptive power saving display refresh rate to the pro series."
amazing review that is not actually a review.
Hey please stay away from this bandwagon just get the phone you can get that fulfills your needs. Trust me those iPhones aren't any better than a 30k INR Android arguably worse in camera(photos). If you want any suggestions tell me so about your needs I will tell ya I know about a lot of Android phones.
Nah iPhone 14 is the iPhone 13s
What is that weather app? Sick !
"Tried to leave apple behind, I regretted it after two weeks"
"The only thing about these phones that frustrates me a bit is the Apple tax. I get it for the Pro/Pro Max, those prices are honestly pretty close to fair, especially when you consider what you get. Apple is by far undercutting many of the top Android flagships when it comes to the price of their top-tier models. But when it comes to the base models, I think they could sell more and make more money overall if they would just lower the price a little. Even just $100 less for each - just try it Apple, even that much would mean people would be much less upset about the 60 hz display, lack of USB 3 speeds, last year’s chip etc. simply because it would be offset by the very idea that “but Apple did drop the price”. And it would make this phone a KILLER value in the eyes of most people, as I already believe it is."
Those sharp corners/edges on the 13 pro literally destroy my hand bruh it hurts lol
Great Video I think iphone 12 is better
I just hate APPLE then also i keep buying their phones 😭
Apple should make a 90hz display and call it fluid motion. That way it’s not “pro”
I just got the iPhone 15 a week ago and love it so far! My last iPhone was the 6
The s24 ads in between is crazy
Got it with t mobile
"I've watched tons of iphone 15 reviews. No one talks about the front and back camera issues where it post processes the images into dark, blurry and grainy! (the processed image is totally different than what you see on viewfinder)  I have iphone mainly for the camera and the image quality the it delivered for the price i paid is so disappointing."
"Great review, you look kinda like the A-train actor with that particular hospital scene from The Boys :face-green-smiling:"
"Purchased iPhone 15, switched from OnePlus Nord 2 5G to iPhone 15. Lot of cellular signal reception issues and WiFi reception issues exist in iPhone. In terms of cellular signal reception, speed OnePlus Nord 2 is much better and faster. Apple support is not helping me on this. Escalated this issue. Please stop buying iPhone 15, not sure about higher variants."
Im still rocking my iphone se 2020 after my 6s got stolen in 2020 . 😂
Moto added the refresh rate because it’s the trendy thing to advertise. It’s worthless unless you’re a hard core mobile gamer.
"The difference between 120hz and 60hz is very noticeable for me. I'm used to 120, so 60 feels jittery to me"
smart phone now is longer so phone need to be 7 inch to work or do something
I am literally watching this video outside the apple store... Looking to upgrade from my S22 to the 15 plus... But the 60hz display is a total deal breaker!!!! Damn!!!!
"the 60hz screen on the base iphone is the reason i stay away from apple phones, i love my ipad pro alr upgraded them 3 times, but the iphone im gonna stay away untill they add 120hz screen to their base model"
Making subtle improvements over time is fine. I think that period of time should be a bit longer than a year when the prices are rocketing hundreds of dollars each time. I guess most people tend not to care because of how accessible these phone plans are these days. “Start a plan with Grift Mobile and get the new iPhone for only 20 a month!”
"if this had 120Hz, i would definitely buy this one... but now i am considering the pro because i really want a 120Hz display"
"So i have never had an iphone in my 27 years let alone what i would call a  ""fancy smartphone"" but I'm buying a new iPhone finally. My dilemma is deciding which to get, the 13 or the new 15. I've heard the 13 is ultimately better and even your saying yourself there is no need to upgrade. But I've also heard the 200 jump is well worth it so what are everyone's options?"
it's worth it to biy for the first apple product? im android user anyways
Imagine they called the blue “Starlight Blue”
how do i get that weather widget
One of the best reviews I have seen. Awesome Content bro
Guys should I buy iphone 15 or 13 pro max? This is my first time to buy iphone
the last 1 min made me go for 15 instead 14.
I had a iPhone 13 and I have the 15 now and the 15 is much better in the camera and battery department I love the Dynamic Island
I don’t know why but this video lets me go off YouTube app and still watch it on a small window but doesn’t with any video else
Still shocked that the iPhone 15 (13) gets a full review video but the S23 doesn’t get one.
Hey mate can you gift a iPhone any iPhone to me I have always dreamt of of it bt i guess god has different plan 🥲 @marques
"I love how perfect iPhones are the software and stuff but I hate how apple has a stick but there ass because the screen is the same on on the 14 Pro and the Plus has the pro max screen, you can pull them off they have the same connectors and it will work you can put it on the touch wont work due to software and the 14 pro screens having different flat glass, screen is 120hz and can have AOD apple just chooses not to enable it in software, Like common the cost of the 120HZ screen already came out my pocket give me the feature"
"i watched,paused,rewinded,played,zoomed and dropped the speed on the video all to find out what weather app that was.
I mean heck i even watched your “what’s on my tech” and your apps videos to try find what the name was and i finally got it 
“(Not boring) Weather “, for those who want to know

i just love the look and aesthetic of it,great video marques! Got informed on the 15 and got a new weather app."
"What can you recommend to a person like me that has a google pixel 5a phone that wants to get a new iPhone 15 series, should I get an iphone 15 or iphone 15pro? I can't really decide 😅"
Um what was that weather app?
Me just ordered a iPhone 13 because the iPhone 15 and 14 are way too expensive
Apple is clever to make easy money. Alot of people keep buying iphone that literally give no shit about the tech upgrade. Less sweat
60 hz in 2024 I would rather get iPhone 13 pro
Thank you for commenting. Doing the lord's work.
Not boring weather app
Not everyone’s poor I got it bc I like the notch and frosted back🥰
I don't like the satin back they look pale and people can't see the Apple logo because of the frosty finish. One of the reasons to own an Iphone is so people can see the Apple logo and they would know you come from money 😂
Want to upgrade my 13 pro max to the regular 15 plus because of the pink color....but experiencing 60 hz screen downgrade from the pro motion screen is a big experience downgrade 😢
I think its unfair to criticise the iphone 50 for its 60Hz i reckon for iphone 16 they will improve it to a 90hz or 120 hz but a 60hz screen is not much of a drastic problem unless you have been using 120Hz on phones for a long time in which you can just buy the 15 pro. Its a great phone and realistically is getting better each year.
My 12 Pro Max froze  up so bought a 15 Pro Max
"Just upgraded from XS Max, only 3 major changes to an average joe like me which are USB-C, Wide angle lens and dynamic island. And of coz longer lasting battery."
"Is it worth it to upgrade to iphone 15 or 15 pro from 13 pro?? I watched these reviews, and everyone keeps saying there aren’t the biggest differences between the 13 models all the way through the 15 models. I have a 13 pro with 90% battery health, and was considering to sell it for a 15 ? Is it worth it? Thanks !!"
Got the 15 it’s worth it .
"My take on the 60 Hz:
I don’t mind it, but goddamn the phones are too expensive to warrant sticking to it. If they were just $100 less, I could justify it, but $800 and $900 phones should at the very least have 75 or 90 Hz, even if it’s not dynamic like the Pros"
the 60Hz screen on a $1000 phone is beyond ridiculous.
"Thank you for your detailed review, as usual. Are you planning on speaking further to iPhone 15 Plus? I'm curious about any possible differences more than what you mentioned."
"i like the black color iphone 15, its simmilar with the pro series"
"Two days ago I upgraded from the iPhone 11 (which I purchased brand new in January of this year) to the iPhone 14 Pro (again, brand new). It feels much smoother with the 120Hz ProMotion display. The cameras are definitely way better. Always-on-display is something I really like. Saves battery."
What’s that weather app
"The reason people don't know much about their phones is because so many today don't read. They don't read the owner's manuals on their cars, appliances, etc. and they don't read up on their phones either. I just don't understand how someone can buy an expensive phone and not take a few minutes to learn how to fully operate it!"
What is the weather app we can see at 3:20 and 4:39 ?
Yo I found you in a mrbeast video
"iphone 15 is the best ever, He’s just biased"
I put an iPhone 15 case on the iPhone 13 and it fit. My sister still doesn't know it.
HI guys. I am in big dilemma and I need your help. I am new in iPhone world so I thinking between iPhone 13 and iPhone 15. What do you recommended me to buy? :)
"What is that weather app🤯
it's !weather on the app store. $15 per year"
The weather app?
Why are Google search results different on this phone than they are on my computer? Even the damn websites look different. It's like I'm looking at search results from an alternate reality. It's stupid.
"went from 10 to 15 today. Only reason is new battery on the 10 was shutting off very quickly, and instead if paying $90 again to replace it, decided to upgrade while the 10s trade in value is decent"
I reluctantly bought this phone. My 12 pro max has finally started to succumb to what I think is water damage. It’s been over 2 years. I expected more time from a CAD $1500 phone. I’m upset that the 15 plus is still $1400 Canadian.
"Apple is the richest company for a reason, less features and you will still buy it like a sucker and they know it lmao"
"im doing research for my wife, and im an android user, so for a regular iphone user, whats the differences between the base model and the pro model?"
"first of all, the iphone 15 is a huge upgrade, from the iphone 11. It has so much quality to it. The 15 never gets hot... it never does anything its great"
It looks attractive honestly. The dynamic island is a nice feature to have.
Me watching this on my iPhone 6s Plus
"zero inovation, it's like nintendo just stopped inovating and swore it's amazing"
I thought this would cover all the 15 iPhones.
Watching this on my iphone 15❤
Me watching on my iphone 7
Im 100% an apple fan and I absolutely love your honest reviews. The only ones I watch 😂❤
Dude No way apple called that white phone blue. These people just be talking
"Went from 13 to 15, worth it."
80% charge limit is actually a very nice addition
I love your reviews always on point
I'm considering switching from android to this 🤭. After the usa vs Russia and china plus usb c😬. Not so good is that it's produced in China 🤣
"Yo, what is that weather app? it looks super cool! 🔥❤"
"I upgraded from 12 to 15. Poor decision that I made as the new iPhone 15 had issues with ringtone. Ringtone does not sound intermittently and without any pattern for the problem. Ended up missing important calls due to this. I stopped using it to avoid trouble with family and friends when they call me. Had a hard time with Apple Support convincing them of the issue. I was a device tester for Apple free of cost for a month to try out each and every troubleshooting step recommended by Apple Support. Finally I had to take a video of the problem using another phone (a 2018 model realme phone!) to capture an issue with a brand new iPhone 15 and save me from the faulty iPhone 15. After about 20 calls with Apple Support they decided to do a full refund. They were clueless about the issue and even the device logs did not capture the issue that I was facing. It was a pathetic experience for 2 months, first with using the faulty device and then with the Apple Support who were just pathetic. I found it weird that they did not offer a replacement instead of refund. In summary, my iPhone 15 did not perform the most basic functionality of letting me know that I have an incoming call by not ringing the ringtone. The fact that it was an intermittent issue made it even harder for me since I have no way to anticipate when this problem would arise."
60hz display the most expensive and yet you shell out your money every year
 @radekskreczko the regular model are for those who have older regular iPhones or pro models below the 13 pro. Of course someone who has 13 pro or 14 pro won’t go to 60hz. But the others won’t even tell the difference. As for what you say it’s true. People just waste money for no reason. I have an iPhone XR but I’m gonna upgrade to the iPhone 15. I don’t care that much for the 120hz since from the XR the 15 will be a huge update anyways.
I think the fresh rate doesn't matter because of the stronger chipset.
​ @solasoul33 it defo does because the problem is yh avg user won't notice it until they have spent their time with only 120 hz then when they fully switch back that's when they notice it and it's quite eh
Alot of ppl are complaining about this phone soo im good😭
I came from a X wow just wow what an upgrade.
"I switched from iPhone 6 to iPhone 15 and I was happy with it exept these 2 cons
1: There is no action button 

2: there is no always on display"
I noticed a big difference between my 14 plus -15 plus. Battery is the best and it feels smooth
"Hey man, thanks for demystifying Apple products for me. Much appreciated 🙌"
I love mine it’s just I wish it still had the same charger
Thank you for being real it’s boring 😂❤. Maybe they actually up it up a little bit I aslo do like their phone just not the color 😮‍💨cough iPhone 13 pro blue Sahara✨
Iphone 15 colors (or lack of) are seriously boring. I'll wait until normal colors are available.
What weather you’re using ?
the SE4 next year will be $799 and its just the iphone 14
Get the new boring iphone  comment is exactly why i switched to android a long time ago. You have so many choices of phones and software. Not to mention the crazy AI tools on the pixels. Curious how apple will respond to the AI wave on new iPhones
They think ahead and hold off on new features so they have a new selling point and something to shout about for the next iPhone
Am gonna go from s22 to iphone 15 I know the 60 hz is gonna feel like absolute garbage but I will probably get used to it in time
I’m in it for the type c honestly
I was using144 hz moto edge 30 ultra and switched to iPhone 14 to understand this display difference. Honestly it’s not much of a big deal. I find it usable without any issue.
"How dare they call this design “all new”- I don’t mind them trying to hype up their phones, I just want them to stop f-ing lying to me 😂"
Also I can’t find the link to your wallpapers :(
Would you recommend iphone 15 or iPhone 14 Plus for someone on iPhone 13
All the technology on this phone and the next 5 is and has already been available for years. They’re just gonna give it to us bit by bit to squeeze us for the most money possible
Do anybody want to accept jesus Christ as your savior he want to accept jesus Christ as your savior he want to give you love peace and happiness and calmness and salvation and eternal life if you confess your sin
Can some1 please tell me what is the intro song
i have a 12 mini is the 15 a good upgrade?
Be nice to see this new phones be  incorporated with a sapphire crystal screen. With the strength and durability a crystal as such would mean the end to buying screen savers and the screen will last years because of the Sapphires durability.
"look at the case, it looks like Iphone 4."
How do I get a weather app like that ?
What if we use a fast charger ? Will it cause any battery health issues?
What day? You let me on the game
I only upgraded from my iPhone 5s because they had stopped updating it when more recent iPhones got dark mode
Bro is roasting while reviewing 😂😂
"Seriously asking. I'm thinking of upgrading from XS to 15 Series, either 15 or 15 Pro.

What did i miss if i get the 15 aside from camera?"
Consumerism
The Galaxy S23 is WAY BETTER than the iPhone 15! I am an S23 user and I know it after this video...
"Great review as usual, thank you."
Should I upgrade from my iPhone 12 to iPhone 15
What’s the name of the weather app he showcased in this video?
She meant Old new 😂
Wallpaper?
"I upgraded from 12 pro to 14 and honestly I can't see much difference, the screen feels brighter but and the battery life is better because it's a new phone, otherwise it feels pretty similar, but i am an average iphone user I only need it to work"
the like button lit up when you mentioned it at 9:27 what is this sorcery
Hands down. Mkbhd is the best tech reviewer in every aspect.
I was confused about what I should do. This video changed my mind. I'm gonna buy it. Thanks marq...
which weather app are you using? looks quit intrestiong! name of the app
This help me make my decision to stick with my iPhone 13 thanks 🙏🏼
I've always been an Android user. Is this the right moment to go to iphone?
I watched this video on my new iPhone 15 the quality on this phone is so good
hahaha... latest and greatest ... a...h!
How old were you back then?
This video reminded me of the Black Mirror episode where the Tennant could not escape their smart house.... ever...
"According to Tim Cook - India is a very important market and in this very important market, Apple doesn't support Apple pay. It is a very good phone but at this price range you can look for samsung which has support for wallets which lets you pay using NFC. And Apple has no plans to launch Apple pay in India. A sore feature to miss in a digital world."
Hey marques great video. I want a USB-C apple phone that’s white but they don’t make it regular. Would you recommend it for being a “white” phone
"I'm upgrading from an iPhone XR to a 15 plus, and I know the jump will be crazy, because I'm already not used to pro level."
Iphone hater troll
What about TechEnthusiastSuraj.
 @SurajNathVlogs  are  you for fkin real
What about sura…
give it a few more months i have it and it’s glitchy
"Yeah I think the 15 is a cash grab but on the other hand I feel like the iphone 15 pro don't have a very sooth display either.  feels like 90hrz ish to me. Definitely never feel's as sooth as my Samsung s23, like, ever. Don't know what that's all about but hey,  it has USB C now so it must be worth it."
"Marques, could you comment on the 15's hearing aidd capabilities for those of us no longer in the sub teen generation?😂"
I only bought Apple Products because of this guy's review. Love the way you review brother!
Im only wondering is it gonna be safe using mcbook pro cable to charge the iphone15 ?
What weather app widget is that at 3:20
I have a 12 mini. Should I upgrade to 15 or 15 Pro. Thoughts anyone?
People still buying iPhone 😂
What is the game at 7:00. Thanks.
"How nobody is not talking about the 'like button' glowing up when Marques mention to press the 'like button'? you can check it out at 9:29 . FYI, i'm watching on my laptop."
can someone please tell me if it’s worth to buy i’m buying it tomorrow but i’m seeing loads of problems with it on tiktok!!
If red colour is also there in iPhone 15 then it will be 🔥
LOOK LIKE A 12 with a diagonal camera
"I upgraded from XR to 15. I have just purchased it a week ago. And for me i dont know the 15’s battery draining tooo fast. Compared to XR. XR had a really great battery life. But this one is disappointing me. Is this the same issue with anyone else?? I mean i dont have much apps in the phone, nor downloading them. Also it is up to date. But still the drainage is stressing me."
Well if everything with the phone is nearly the same then why is it more expensive
"Hi marqueze just a positive constructive comment , now that your videos have the option to hear them in Spanish , when you click on the option it shows ESPAÑOL that means Spanish but really means SPANIARD , ESPAÑOL is not a language the right word for the language is CASTELLANO, best regards"
I went from the 11 to the 15 pro max (I change my phone every 4 years) I noticed the refresh rate cause I when I try get something off my 11 to put on my 15 PM it felt so laggy and I was like wtf the phone never used to lag.
Okay what is that sick looking weather widget he used? Could someone out there help this poor me out?
"Hey i'm willing to buy an iphone 15  but i heard about overheating issue , is it real ?"
wait a few more months till they fix the bugs but i love mine besides the glitches ❤
It’s been fixed with an update.
Marques could you make a video on how to customize your iphone 15 like you do in the video
"Hi Marques,
I have had an iPhone 13 Mini for 15 months. I would like to trade for an iP13 or iP15. The reason is a better battery and a bigger screen. At one side 15 is the latest model, but 13 will save some money. Honestly, 60Hz is ok for me.
Is it ok to buy iP13 now end of 2023?"
Imagine paying >$800 for a 60hz phone in 2023 (almost 2024).
"I almost forgot that I told myself I will never purchase another Apple product again after they made the non-pro version of the iPhone 12 have a screen brightness that was artificially limited just because the phone wasn’t a pro version.

Steve Jobs would have NEVER done something so scummy to his loyal customers.

Apple is pro-censorship, pro-globalist agenda and should be regarded as a pro-fascist entity."
Is the next Iphone 16 baseline model going to get this year new Chip A17 Pro since it has the PRO naming that it's only for PRO Models.
Can someone please buy me a new phone(I'm poor) I said please😢
"AS A MOM WITH BUSY KIDS IN THE BACKGROUND, the voice isolation is a big one"
What’s the WEATHER WIDGET he uses in the video
"Two days ago I upgraded from the iPhone 11 (which I purchased brand new in January of this year) to the iPhone 14 Pro (again, brand new). It feels much smoother with the 120Hz ProMotion display. The cameras are definitely way better. Always-on-display is something I really like. Saves battery."
got an iPhone 15 today and I can't wait for it to come in
"Upgraded from the XS Max to a 15 Plus, I’m so happy!"
Great video! Does anyone by chance know or recognize what weather app he’s using that shows at 2:43?
"I don't know but I'm an android fan, but still till last year I would see upgrades on iPhone, though the simplest of upgrades costed huge bucks. But this year I just don't see any major difference. Why would some one switch from 14 to 15. Still it's apple so you can't argue people would just go and buy an iPhone the moment it launches, even though they have no knowledge about the difference in them. In India it went out of stock really fast. I guess a time gap of 2-3 yrs minimum is a good to buy a new phone."
Great review! But where is the section about repairability and sustainability? It was a pledge you made in the Fairphone 4 video from a year ago!
"Any suggestions for upgrading from XR, iPhone 14 or 15? What will I choose?"
You smiles 😊 when you said “Nothing inside new” 😅
Yeah bro that's crazy. I bought a 500 dollar a54 and I couldn't be happier
Why would u go for the iphone 14 pro... u should've just got the 15 pro or 15 in general
 @Tsumi784 is the 15 better than the 14 pro?
" @Getthedotty  the price is practically the same, why would u get the last gen."
 @Getthedotty No the iphone 14 pro and 15 are identical internally but the iphone 14 pro is cheaper and is built better not to mention it has 120hz display only thing it’s missing is the usbc
 @Tsumi784 14 pro better than 15 👌🏻
Noo dont go for the iphone 15 pro!
You must have too much money to spend if you’re buying new phones all the time.
"At the end of the day, the 15 will be better, but get a 14 if you're looking to save a bit of money"
 IPhone 15
I got it for free so I’m not complaining BUT I’ve had it for an hour and it’s just a bigger version of the 12 mini I had before lol
can someone tell me what’s the weather app he uses here 3:21 ?
I am 100% the basic iPhone buyer.  I have never owned a smart phone that wasn’t an iPhone.  I’m in my mid 30’s and I upgrade once ever 3-6 years depending on how the battery in my old phone holds up.  If Apple made revolutionary changes to the phone every year I wouldn’t have stuck with them. I like the late adopting gently nudging me into the future.  I don’t like change so give me changes I barely see.
"upgraded from the XR to the 15 and it was definitely worth it, at least for me"
I'm upgrading from an iPhone 6 (that's slow and laggy) and look forward to seeing the difference!
I had an Iphone XR ... now 15 plus .. kind good 👍🏻👍🏻
What’s the weather app!?
my stepdad just got the 15 upgraded from iphone 6s
my wifi connections suck big time with my iPhone 15 Pro!? anyone else got this problem?
Watched review after buying 15 plus 😂
I have the iPhone 12 Pro Max would it be worth upgrading to the iPhone 15?
Watching this on my iPhone 15
"The Isolation mode has there in Samsung phones for a year now and it works amazingly. The base iPhone 15 is amazing, the only issue is, how can a company not give a 120hrz or 90hrz display at this ridiculously high price point otherwise, it genuinely feels like an upgrade to the base iPhones from previous years. Just because of the display hertz, it's hard for a 120hrz Android user to make a switch to the iPhone which costs 2x with fewer features except the camera."
"this is base iphone ?, i thought its the iPhone SE."
Can u do the HHO Gene Gpod.
Went from a iPhone 11 Pro Max to a “basic” 15 and can attest that the refresh rate difference IS extremely noticeable. I can’t say the 15 sucks b/c of it’s 60hz but it’s not great when you’re used to 120hz… should’ve went with the 15 pro. Otherwise worth the upgrade for sure!
"I keep uograding my base iphones to the newer base models , but im rlly doubting to switch over to a pro or some 
. upgrading to a new base model doesnt feel like an upgrade anymore"
They should’ve never went away with the home button. Face ID is no good touch screen ID was more personal.
Still satisfied with my iPhone SE 2020
You should probably wait one more year.
These updates got my battery 🔥 so I just updated from I phone xr to 15
What’s that cool weather app u using?
"12 Mini owner here and i ""upgraded"" to the 15. Im pretty happy with the 15, but here and then i switch the sim card to the 12 Mini and use it again for a while, the difference is small but the 12 Mini is so ""tiny"" and 1-hand holdable/usable and the cameras are way less standing out compared to the 15. The 15 is ofc my goto if i expect to shoot some photos or videos (256GB model), but the 12 Mini is sometimes still my regular phone for basic stuff"
They are saving the 90Hz refresh rate display as an all new update for their upcoming models 😂
"Also, you almost killed the new iPhone lol"
With the 16 base model I expect a redesign and at least 90hz I have a 14pm as my main phone and a iPhone 13 as a second phone and you can definitely tell a huge difference in refresh rate but the 60hz is not bad at all still buttery smooth and fast enough I also agree on the a15 vs a16 you can’t really tell on day to day usage with reg apps
Im not buying this tbh
will i go for iphone 14 or 15 from 11?
599 pound 💷 for black Friday unfortunately none buy it or show interested to look a iPhone line ...They just walk thru they don't look and they escape fast as they could without buying or see in at all ....Bad reputation..Xiaomi sold a lot probably 2 Milion PSC just for short time and probably 100-150 iphones
"Is the weather app that you have widgeted in the top right corner the standard weather app that comes with the phone? I love the look, but mine looks different"
Got an iPhone X with a new battery and new glass back.   Can’t decide whether to trade in for 256gb base 15 or go for an 128gb pro.
4:55 you said it perfectly yourself. There is no real difference between these phones anymore. So why make new ones that are so expensive.
"This is like a car manufacturer selling their high end car, and their low end car. Except the low end car the seats seatbelts and wheels were purposely taken out to sell the other one 😂"
60hz hurts my eyes
I can use 120hz on the phone i have... but believe me you get at least 25% less battery time its eating your battery
Rich people forget some of us (me) have an iPhone 7...
To think I actually saw you the other day in real life.
But still love iphone 15 this phone is more changes ❤😊😅
"15 because of USB-C. I did it for compatibility with other USB-C accessories such as SD card reader for camera stuff or USB-C sticks, as much i would have loved to stick with lightning (more robust port) USB-C port opens up more capabilities than lightning"
 @harrison00xXx   heating issues?
" @armaanshah8148  nope, absolutely cool only under 3d mark 20 minute stress test while charging it got warm, but it tried to charge fast while running the hardware resulting in 15-30W power draw (140W Macbook AC adapter) so in this case heat is allowed.

I charge it exclusively (if possible…) with an old 5W iPhone power brick over a regular USB-A to USB-C cable where it stays absolutely cool"
128 pro if the price is similar enough. I was going for the 15 with 256GB instead (no need for the tele-camera or raw video/photo)
 @harrison00xXx  the pro is 100 more  for 128  gb vs 256 for regular 15. The thing that bothers me is the slower refresh rate of the regular 15 vs 15 pro
" @tkkcali  are you a smartphone gamer and really profit from 120hz? So at least fast shooters etc? Then yes, 15 Pro!

I personally dont mind smartphone gaming so 60Hz was just fine, i play on a (60Hz…) iPad Air M1

I would recommend to watch for other stuff when it comes to your choice… mainly cameras (iPhone 15 Pro is superior in ultrawide and tele 3x and beyond), battery runtime (Pro is drained very fast under wrong circumstances, A17 chip is powerhungry),  Always-on-display, storage (thats why i picked the non pro, 256GB are still not much)"
" @harrison00xXx  not a gamer.  Just pissed Apple has 60hz on a $900 phone in 2023   All other phones this price range have at least 90 hz, most 120hz.  It’s like apple intentionally does this to make you buy a pro model.  Although I’ve heard apples 60hz is smoother compared to some of the competitors at the same rate or higher.  So confused as to the importance of 60 vs 120.  The 15 base cameras are enough for me.  I’ll probably go with a green 256 gb regular 15 though. It’s just I see comments like 60 hz is old tech and 60 hz is too slow, etc.    my iPhone X from 6 years ago had 60. Hz screen!"
" @tkkcali  and yeah thats true, i had a Vivo smartphone with 90Hz and it looked worse than even an „ancient“ iPhone (SE 2016).

Yeah its a shame, 75, better 90 or 120 Hz should be in this device as well on all iPads, but on the other side - 60Hz are just fine, even fast paced shooters on my 60Hz iPad are very enjoyable and i dont feel handicapped in any way by 60Hz

If you also want more storage for „less“ money i think you just have to accept the 60Hz, its fine, for real.
On the computer… no way i would want to play with 60Hz except for slower single player games where i want 4k resolution in HDR on TV (otherwise 2k/1440p resolution on 120hz with TV or 165Hz on gaming monitor)"
" @tkkcali  Also keep in mind refresh rate is not everything.  Especially with OLED you have so much other things to care about:
- brightness, and 15/15Pro screens are bright!
- color accuracy where apple is best in class
- motion handling… a „bad“ 120Hz OLED screen with simple controller can look worse than a 60Hz screen with good controller behind it which does good and fast BFI
- longevity… i had only a 12 Mini so far which has OLED but no burn-in yet unlike some  friends android smartphones"
" @harrison00xXx  yeah my iPhone X (first apple oled display) still has a good display , with a new glass back an 99 percent battery.  I still like it but not supported any more.  It still feels modern to me. Thanks for your advice"
"For me it was the abysmal battery runtime of the 12 Mini to get a 15 non-Pro. As much i dont like the formfactor (im the SE/Mini iPhone guy…) its a improvement over the 12 Mini for sure
But thats also a downside… im now much more in the social media trap again since i have reasonable battery runtime haha @tkkcali "
The screen refresh thing is OVERRATED. It’s not worth spending money on.
This was the worst iPhone experience I’ve ever had. I bought this stupid phone when it came out and it wouldn’t work. I don’t know how else to say it. There was an issue with me having a physical sim and this iPhone only having eSIM. It doesn’t have a sim tray! My phone carrier couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t connect to the internet. They told me there was an issue with the phone. So I returned it and never looked back. That was 4 hours of my life I’ll never get back.
Bros intro is better than the apple iphone commercial
Went from 12 to 15 same thing
Does anybody else seeing freezing on new 15 are just me
If you're a techie you can simply tell difference about 60z to 90z of display
"Im considering getting the new iphone, although the auto portrait mode has been used by huawei since the p20 pro. I often wonder how the smartphone landscape would look like if the ban never happened."
Okay so i have the iphone 8 pro i was thinking of upgrading to the 15 but i have heard many bad reviews do u think they will fix it or do u think its worth buying cause im not sure😅
I’m watching this on my iPhone 15
"🗣Come on, man, just tell the truth. Don't have to hide it or say it in different type of codes. Just say the iPhone really sucks and keep showing the same stuff. Nothing's new only the software. That they're making or rebuilding. Not bad, but the iPhone. The way it looks still the same squat. IPhone corporation could have done better but I guess they're running out of ideas.🤣🤦‍♂️☘️🎱🔮☯️"
What The hell is that weather app?!
I switched from a 120hz android with a snapdragon 888 to a 15 plus I daily drive a 144hz monitor I can feel windows 60hz vs 144 but going from a great android phone to a 15 plus it feels the same it does feel slower than my 120hz iPad
Is the cable Mfi?

My non-Pro 15 had sim slots and they are working as intended
 @harrison00xXx  In the U.S.A. they don't have sim slots.
​ @aarontoa If you move to a different country that will fix the issue...
"12 Mini to 15.... same thing (pretty much, 12 Mini is smaller and 1-hand holdable and usable)

I switch between those devices here and then.... 12 Mini is still an awesome device for basic stuff such as TELEPHONE ONLY"
"Yes, so what?

I notice also the difference between a 300 HP ICE car and a 700HP electric car, but do i need the 700HP electrical? Do i even need the 300HP? NO! In fact i dont even need the 180HP my car has ;)"
"Im very happy with it, even a little improvement over the 12 Mini i still have and sometimes use (1 hand usability!)"
"Yep the 15s main camera is pretty awesome and i like it, but for basic stuff my 12 Mini with the ""old"" 12MP camera isnt much worse to be honest. Only the wide angle camera module is much worse on the 12 Mini"
I have voice isolation on my 11 Pro Max. Are we sure it's new?
"1% drop in exactly 1 month in my iPhone 15

Is this normal??"
"Hey Marques, do you think this is the Apple's best iPhone ever?"
"I have the 11, i think I’ll just wait till they do something crazy. Because i don’t really NEED - the new tech atm"
For normal users std iphone is more than enough and pro model is for content creators
"anyone feels the iphone 15 kinda ""laggy"", specially when typing"
A few ppl talk about one of the biggest nosense downsides of the 15 …in usa it only allow Esim and not normal sim …it’s so stupid . Why limiting a phone you pay 1000€ to only allow esim which is still not common worldwide (if you travel for example) when the normal phone with the physical sim can accept the sim plus the esim . I literally just walked out of an Apple Store without buying the phone for that very reason 👎
"I would like to say when someone pays 799$ for a phone they should notice everything and should not let apple slip away with 60Hz in 2023, shameful.!!"
"800 dollars?! Man, a standard iPhone 15 (cheapest version) costs more than 1 100 USD here in Sweden.."
I was listening to you talk about the refresh rate and I was like EXACTLY!!!!
Bruh give me an iPhone 15 pro max tried hard to win but failed several times😢
"When Apple says all-new design, they mean I can’t wait for these suckers to buy the same old phone with slight improvements again this year. I see you Apple 😂."
Has Marques ever admitted to being wrong about iphones and usb-c?
You talking to much bro
Is it true Foxcon has added extensive tracking capabilities?
what was the phone stand you were using??1?!
What is that game he played @7:00???
Iphone design is old.
"shameful to still support android, 60 Hz or 120Hz... i cant care less on a phone. Different story on a (gaming) PC setup and partially even iPads/Tablets (for gaming...)"
Come to Greece and get it for 799:) I just did😂 Black Friday is a blessing
What!…………
"iPhone 14 user? :D

I ""upgraded"" from 12 Mini to the 15, yes except the size barely anything changed, but a 48MP camera with 12MP 2x mode is a nice to have and a big improvement over previous iPhones. Still, i often use my 12 Mini... its just the ""better"" phone for basic stuff since its 1-hand usable with ease and does phone and messenger stuff good enough."
I just upgraded from an iphone 13 and man do I already love it. sure its nothing crazy new but the battery and camera are insane.
Many people have strange thoughts. Seems good  👍
Support be super fast charging… NOT ! My phone gets so hot I’m scared it will start fire. Went to where I bought it to tell them . They told me yes they r known for being hot because they r working so hard to download. WHAT ??
I was tempted to upgrade but still very happy with my iPhone 11. Battery still great
I’ve been watching this guy for years and he’s influenced quite literally every single tech purchase I’ve ever made
Voce isolation has been on my iphone 13 pro for a very long time now
I actually love it ❤
"upgraded from Iphone 7 to 15, mostly because faster charge and USB-C, yes I know it could charge faster, yes i know its not much in 2023, BUT, compared to my Iphone 7, It's a big upgrade for me, and I'm planning to use it in the next 5 years or so"
"This is going to be my first Iphone since Im getting tired of Android going backwards in quality and design. So the whole ""it's the same as last years design"" doesn't bother me at all. This was very informative."
I think the display refresh rate is set at 60Hz because of battery life. I've had a oneplus with 120Hz but it significantly decreases the battery time. Also running it in battery save mode will instantly drop the refresh rate.
iphones are like eating meat over and over again
"paying 1500€ for a phone 🤦🤦🤮 ,, this cost maximum 200€ ,, they selling garbage to garbage people"
"I wish the pro models never came out, it use to be easy to pick your phone. Now there’s 15 of them. I miss the 6 and 6 plus days. 😅"
"iOS 17.1 buggy as hell
My iPhone keeps turning off 🤷‍♂️"
People using basic iphone care more about battery than display so 120Hz display without changing frequency would be bad idea.
"From 12 Mini to 15. battery and camera are the biggest improvements i found, especially battery coming from a 12 Mini with >600 charging cycles on the battery.

And still i pick for the weekend or some other stuff my 12 Mini here and then... so much simpler, more compact, smaller camera thingy standing out, 1-hand usability. Im nearly dissapointed by the iPhone 15, but the awesome battery life and bright screen (i use it as camera monitor) are excuse enough."
"As if the 6/6 Plus days were that nice. I got a iPhone 6s as iPhone 5 replacement (broke it entirely with a repair attempt) and gave it to my mum because it SUCKED. Got myself a 2nd hand iPhone SE (first gen, 6S hardware but in a lovely iPhone 5 case)."
my regular ass S23 GOT PRO MOTION BEEEEEOOATCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
iPhone15😊
The iPhone 15 is a cheaply made piece of crap.  It is the “we went too cheap” version.  It overheats so they had to slow it down.  It is so flimsy it breaks if you put it in your back pocket.  It has several issues all due to poor quality and cheap engineering.  It’s like a cheap Samsung…definitely not built to last or even close to Apple’s usual standards.  If this is how Apple is moving in to the future it will do so without me.
So the camera's of iPhone 15 is better than 14 pro ?
What's the link to that iPhone stand?
Had the the iPhone 15 for a few weeks now and I love it
We have voice isolation since iOS 15 and supported in iPhone Xs also. What was new?
Even as a it guy and phone nerd i dont care for 120hz
At this point any iPhone would be considered an upgrade from my Redmi note 9 pro 💀
First video I’m watching on my IPhone 15😂
"I was thinking of getting the 15 basic because I have the 13 basic. I just wanted faster screen hz, but no surprise it’s 60 hz yet again. I love my 6.1 screen size, any bigger is to much. So thanks for this review."
I got a iPhone 11 and I’m thinking bout upgrading. Should I just get a 14 pro or should I say fck it and get the 15 pro?
"I upgraded to from the 11 to the 12 , the 12 feels lighter and moves faster, i bought my iphone 11 in 2020 and it started moving slow over time because of new iphones coming out but i love the 12 because of the oled and new feel it was on 225"

"It’s more complicated when zoom is involved, but yes a default shot will tend to look better as a result of the new 24MP binning on iPhone 15 as opposed to 14 Pro."
Bro Your phone Got heating and how is battery?
"Wait, for 16 just maybe."
I agree I switched from 14 plus to 15 smaller to me is better 😊
Appreciate not being a size queen..
I just switched from a oneplus due to abysmal software updates and it had 120hz refresh rate. Trust me the iPhone 15 is smooth despite the number saying 60
"‪Rather than focusing on titanium, Apple need to focus on sorting out their sub standard spellcheck ‬"
Went from an iPhone 12 to a 15 plus and it genuinely feels like a big upgrade
“All new” only Apple can pull off this biggest scam in tech industry 😂😂
"The fact is, the display in the I15 pro has the exact same specs as the one in the i15 except for the hertz. So it wouldn’t make sense for Apple to produce 2 different screens for the i15 and i15 pro. The i15 display is probably just locked to 60hz via software, so apple has one more reason to buy an I15 pro"
"So I’ve switched from S21 Plus to IPhone 15 Pro Max and umm yes it looks better and the interface is cleaner but for me the overall functionality is lacking compared to Samsung. 
Also the customisability isn’t as good."
"No one should care about the 60Hz vs 120.. the phones with 120 have much weaker battery life anyways. I don't see any reason to upgrade until it's a true full screen display and 3-4 day battery life, might be waiting a while."
"I got 11, getting 15 mainly cuz I plan to have it for the next 3 or 4 years before upgrading again."
"Anyone having problems with battery draining too fast on iPhone15?? 
Just by casually opening it and checking my messages and some instagram each 0.5/1 hour and 2h screen on time in total at 7pm i was left with 60%.."
For me I upgraded from iPhone XR to iPhone 15. I’m loving it and will probably upgrade when it’s at iPhone 19 or 20 (XXR). We will see what technology does in the future.
